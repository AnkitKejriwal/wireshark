This is a work in progress to enhance and replace the existing ldap dissector with an asn2eth generated one.

To test/use this work in progress dissector you will have to compile it with asn2eth and copy the resulting .c and .h files over to epan/dissectors.

This dissector is not yet ready for public consumption and lacks many vital features of the existing ldap dissector such as CLDAP support.
