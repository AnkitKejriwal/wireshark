This is a work in progress to enhance and replace the existing snmp dissector with an asn2wrs generated one.

To test/use this work in progress dissector you will have to compile it with asn2wrs and copy the resulting .c and .h files over to epan/dissectors.

This dissector is not yet ready for public consumption and lacks many vital features of the existing snmp dissector.
