This is a work in progress to replace the existing ansi_map dissector with an asn2wrs generated one.

To test/use this work in progress dissector you will have to compile it with asn2wrs and copy the resulting .c and .h files over to epan/dissectors.

This dissector is not yet ready for public consumption and lacks many vital features of the existing ansi_map dissector as it does not dissect
parameter data.
