/*
 * Either LBL NRG wasn't an adequate central registry (e.g., because of
 * the slow rate of releases from them), or nobody bothered using them
 * as a central registry, as many different groups have patched libpcap
 * (and BPF, on the BSDs) to add new encapsulation types, and have ended
 * up using the same DLT_ values for different encapsulation types.
 *
 * For those numerical encapsulation type values that everybody uses for
 * the same encapsulation type (which inclues those that some platforms
 * specify different DLT_ names for but don't appear to use), we map
 * those values to the appropriate Wiretap values.
 *
 * For those numerical encapsulation type values that different libpcap
 * variants use for different encapsulation types, we check what
 * <pcap.h> defined to determine how to interpret them, so that we
 * interpret them the way the libpcap with which we're building
 * Wireshark/Wiretap interprets them (which, if it doesn't support
 * them at all, means we don't support them either - any capture files
 * using them are foreign, and we don't hazard a guess as to which
 * platform they came from; we could, I guess, choose the most likely
 * platform).
 *
 * Note: if you need a new encapsulation type for libpcap files, do
 * *N*O*T* use *ANY* of the values listed here!  I.e., do *NOT*
 * add a new encapsulation type by changing an existing entry;
 * leave the existing entries alone.
 *
 * Instead, send mail to tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org, asking for
 * a new DLT_ value, and specifying the purpose of the new value.  When
 * you get the new DLT_ value, use that numerical value in the "dlt_value"
 * field of "pcap_to_wtap_map[]".

	 * 50 is DLT_PPP_SERIAL in NetBSD; it appears that DLT_PPP
	 * on BSD (at least according to standard tcpdump) has, as
	 * the first octet, an indication of whether the packet was
	 * transmitted or received (rather than having the standard
	 * PPP address value of 0xff), but that DLT_PPP_SERIAL puts
	 * a real live PPP header there, or perhaps a Cisco PPP header
	 * as per section 4.3.1 of RFC 1547 (implementations of this
	 * exist in various BSDs in "sys/net/if_spppsubr.c", and
	 * I think also exist either in standard Linux or in
	 * various Linux patches; the implementations show how to handle
	 * Cisco keepalive packets).
	 *
	 * However, I don't see any obvious place in FreeBSD "if_ppp.c"
	 * where anything other than the standard PPP header would be
	 * passed up.  I see some stuff that sets the first octet
	 * to 0 for incoming and 1 for outgoing packets before applying
	 * a BPF filter to see whether to drop packets whose protocol
	 * field has the 0x8000 bit set, i.e. network control protocols -
	 * those are handed up to userland - but that code puts the
	 * address field back before passing the packet up.
	 *
	 * I also don't see anything immediately obvious that munges
	 * the address field for sync PPP, either.
	 *
	 * Wireshark currently assumes that if the first octet of a
	 * PPP frame is 0xFF, it's the address field and is followed
	 * by a control field and a 2-byte protocol, otherwise the
	 * address and control fields are absent and the frame begins
	 * with a protocol field.  If we ever see a BSD/OS PPP
	 * capture, we'll have to handle it differently, and we may
	 * have to handle standard BSD captures differently if, in fact,
	 * they don't have 0xff 0x03 as the first two bytes - but, as per
	 * the two paragraphs preceding this, it's not clear that
	 * the address field *is* munged into an incoming/outgoing
	 * field when the packet is handed to the BPF device.
	 *
	 * For now, we just map DLT_PPP_SERIAL to WTAP_ENCAP_PPP, as
	 * we treat WTAP_ENCAP_PPP packets as if those beginning with
	 * 0xff have the standard RFC 1662 "PPP in HDLC-like Framing"
	 * 0xff 0x03 address/control header, and DLT_PPP_SERIAL frames
	 * appear to contain that unless they're Cisco frames (if we
	 * ever see a capture with them, we'd need to implement the
	 * RFC 1547 stuff, and the keepalive protocol stuff).
	 *
	 * We may have to distinguish between "PPP where if it doesn't
	 * begin with 0xff there's no HDLC encapsulation and the frame
	 * begins with the protocol field" (which is how we handle
	 * WTAP_ENCAP_PPP now) and "PPP where there's either HDLC
	 * encapsulation or Cisco PPP" (which is what DLT_PPP_SERIAL
	 * is) at some point.
	 *
	 * XXX - NetBSD has DLT_HDLC, which appears to be used for
	 * Cisco HDLC.  Ideally, they should use DLT_PPP_SERIAL
	 * only for real live HDLC-encapsulated PPP, not for Cisco
	 * HDLC.
