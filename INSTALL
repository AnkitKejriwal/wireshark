Installation Checklist
======================

  [ ] 0. This is alpha software.  Beware.
  
  [ ] 1. Make sure you have GTK+ installed.  Try running 'gtk-config
         --version'.  If you need to install/reinstall GTK, you can find
         it at

         http://www.gtk.org .

         Ethereal needs gtk+-1.2.0 or above.

         If you installed GTK+ from a binary package, you may have to
         install a "development" package; there may be separate "user's"
         and "developer's" packages, with the former not including
         header files and the like.  For example, Red Hat users will
         need to install a "gtk-devel" .rpm.

  [ ] 2. If you want to capture packets, make sure you have libpcap
         installed.  The latest "official" version can be found at
          
         http://www.tcpdump.org .

         If you've downloaded the 0.5.2 version, make sure you install
         the headers ('make install-incl') when you install the library.
         The CVS snapshots will install the headers if you do 'make
         install', and have no 'install-incl' target.

         If you installed libpcap from a binary package, you may have to
         install a "development" package; for example, there's
         apparently a "libpcap0" Debian package, but it just includes a
         shared library, a copyright notice, changelog files, and a
         README file - you also need to install a "libpcap-dev" package
         to get header files, a non-shared library, and the man page.
         Similarly, Red Hat 5.x users will need to install a "libpcap-devel"
         .rpm to go along with the "libpcap" .rpm.

  [ ] 3. Run './configure' in the Ethereal distribution directory.
         Running './configure --help' displays a list of options.
         The file 'INSTALL.configure' contains general instructions for
         using 'configure' and 'make'.

         Ethereal installs a support file (manuf) in /usr/local/etc by
         default.  You can change this location with the --sysconfdir
         option.

         The --disable-pcap option allows you to compile without libpcap.
         You won't be able to capture packets, but you can read traces
         that have already been captured to disk by other programs.

         You can build or not build ethereal, tethereal, editcap, and
         mergecap with the appropriate --enable-XXX or --disable-XXX
         flags.  The default is to build everything. If GTK+ is not
         detected on the system, then ethereal won't be built.

  [ ] 4. Run 'make'.  Hopefully, you won't run into any problems.

  [ ] 5. Run './ethereal', and make sure things are working.  You must
         have root privileges in order to capture live data.

  [ ] 6. Run 'make install'.  If you wish to install the man page, run
         'make install-man'.  If you're running a system that supports
         the Apt, RPM, or System V Release 4 packaging systems, you can
         run one of

         make debian-package	# Builds a binary package using dpkg
         make rpm-package	# Builds a binary package using rpm
         make srpm-package	# Builds a source package using rpm
         make svr4-package	# Builds a source package using pkgmk
         make solaris-package	# Same as "make svr4-package"

         to make an installable package for your system.

If you have trouble with the build or installation process, you can
find assistance on the ethereal-users and ethereal-dev mailing lists.
