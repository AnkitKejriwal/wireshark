Installation Checklist
======================

  [ ] 0. This is alpha software.  Beware.
  
  [ ] 1. Make sure you have GTK+ installed.  Try running 'gtk-config
         --version'.  If you need to install/reinstall GTK, you can find
         it at

         http://www.gtk.org .

         Ethereal needs gtk+-1.2.0 or above.

         If you installed GTK+ from a binary package, you may have to
         install a "development" package; there may be separate "user's"
         and "developer's" packages, with the former not including
         header files and the like.  For example, Red Hat users will
         need to install a "gtk-devel" .rpm.

  [ ] 2. If you want to capture packets, make sure you have libpcap
         installed.  The latest version can be found at
          
         ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov .

         Make sure you install the headers ('make install-incl') when you
         install the library.

         If you installed libpcap from a binary package, you may have to
         install a "development" package; for example, there's
         apparently a "libpcap0" Debian package, but it just includes a
         shared library, a copyright notice, changelog files, and a
         README file - you also need to install a "libpcap-dev" package
         to get header files, a non-shared library, and the man page.
         Similarly, Red Hat 5.x users will need to install a "libpcap-devel"
         .rpm to go along with the "libpcap" .rpm.

  [ ] 3. Run './configure' in the Ethereal distribution directory.
         Running './configure --help' displays a list of options.
         The file 'INSTALL.configure' contains general instructions for
         using 'configure' and 'make'.

         Ethereal installs a support file (manuf) in /usr/local/etc by
         default.  You can change this location with the --sysconfdir
         option.

         The --disable-pcap option allows you to compile without libpcap.
         You won't be able to capture packets, but you can read traces
         that have already been captured to disk by other programs.

  [ ] 4. Run 'make'.  Hopefully, you won't run into any problems.

  [ ] 5. Run './ethereal', and make sure things are working.  You must
         have root privileges in order to capture live data.

  [ ] 6. Run 'make install'.  If you wish to install the man page, run
         'make install-man'.  You're done.
