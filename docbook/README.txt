This directory contains the source files needed to build the:

Ethereal User's guide (almost ready to release, has to be reviewed) 

and the:

Ethereal Developer's Guide  (long time unchanged still a very early state).

To build the User's Guide, just do 'make', but see requirements below.
The Developer's Guide is currently not generated, as it has no content.


The guides are written in Docbook/XML (formerly Docbook/SGML). This format is 
now used by many other documentation projects, e.g. "the linux documentation 
project" uses it too.

To get HTML, PDF or other output formats, conversions are done using XSL 
stylesheets, which provides a flexible way for these conversions.

The current Makefile is running under Win32 in the cygwin environment, so it uses 
GNU make and such. It should be pretty easy to use it in UNIX environments too.
Using Microsoft make (nmake) is not supported.

By default the Makefile generates HTML in single page and multiple (chunked) formats.
Optional output formats are PDF and CHM.


Requirements:
-------------

Settings in Makefile and catalog.xml
------------------------------------
You have to edit the settings in these files, to point to the DTD/XSL files, fop (and possibly hhc).

DocBook XML DTD
---------------
DocBook "official" XML DTD V4.2 from:
http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/
(or using cygwin package docbook-xml42)

DocBook XSL
-----------
The "official" XSL stylesheets from Norman Walsh:
http://docbook.sourceforge.net/
(or using cygwin package docbook-xsl)

xsltproc
--------
The XSL processor xsltproc. 
(it seems to be packages libxml2 and libxslt, ... please give comments)

FOP processor (for PDF generation only)
---------------------------------------
FOP processor from the apache project:
http://xml.apache.org/fop/
FOP is a JAVA program, so you need to have a JAVA environment installed.
I have put the fop-0.20.5 dir right into the sources dir. If you have it somewhere else,
you'll have to change the setting in the Makefile.

Be sure to also have installed JAI and/or jimi to be able to use/convert the png graphics files.
The fop release note webpage tells how to do it: 
download jimi from:
http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/
then extract the archive, then copy JimiProClasses.zip to FOP's lib dir and rename it to jimi-1.0.jar.

As I got OutOfMemoryException when running fop, I had to insert -Xmx256m into the last line of the fop.bat file from:
java -cp "%LOCALCLASSPATH%" org.apache.fop.apps.Fop %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8
to:
java -Xmx256m -cp "%LOCALCLASSPATH%" org.apache.fop.apps.Fop %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8

HTML help compiler (for chm file generation only)
-------------------------------------------------
hhc compiler from Microsoft:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp 


Makefile:
---------
There are several ways and tools to do these conversion, following is a short 
description of the way the makefile targets are doing things and which output 
files required for a release in that format.

all
Will generate all output formats (see below).

make eug_html
The HTML file is generated using xsltproc and the XSL stylesheets from 
Norman Walsh. This is a conversion into a single HTML page.
output: eug_html

make eug_htmlchunk
The HTML files are generated using xsltproc and the XSL stylesheets from 
Norman Walsh. This is a conversion into chunked (multiple) HTML pages.
output: eug_html_chunked

make eug_pdf_us
make eug_pdf_a4
The PDF is generated using an intermediate format named XSL-FO (XSL 
formatting objects). xsltproc converts the XML to a FO file, and then fop 
(apache's formatting object processor) is used to generate the PDF document, 
in US letter or A4 paper format.
TIPP: You will get lot's of INFO/WARNING/ERROR messages when generating pdf, 
but conversation works just fine.
output: user-guide.pdf

make eug_chm
On Win32 platforms, the "famous" HTML help format can be generated by using a 
special HTML chunked conversion and then use the htmlhelp compiler from 
Microsoft.
output: htmlhelp.chm

The makefile is written to be run with gmake on unix/linux platforms. Win32 
platforms have to use the cygwin environment (Microsoft nmake is not 
supported).
