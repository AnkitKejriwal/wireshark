  In this chapter some advanced features of Ethereal will be described.
  </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="ChAdvFollowTCPSection"><title>Following TCP streams</title>
    <para>
      There will be occasions when you would like to see the data from a TCP 
      session in the order that the application layer sees it. Perhaps 
      you are looking for passwords in a Telnet stream, or you are 
      trying to make sense of a data stream.  If so, Ethereal's ability to 
      follow a TCP stream will be useful to you. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Simply select a TCP packet in the stream/connection you are interested 
      in and then select the Follow TCP Stream menu item from the Ethereal 
      Tools menu.  Ethereal will pop up a separate window with all the data 
      from the TCP stream laid out in order, as shown in 
      <xref linkend="ChAdvFollowStream"/>.
    </para>

    </figure>
    <para>
      You can choose from the following actions:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>Save As</command> Save the stream data in the currently
		selected format.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>Print</command> Print the stream data in the currently
		selected format.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>Direction</command> Choose the stream direction to be 
		displayed ("Entire conversation", "data from A to B only" or "data 
		from B to A only").
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>Filter out this stream</command> Apply a display filter 
		removing the current TCP stream data from the display.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>Close</command> Close this dialog box.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      You can then choose to view the data in one of four formats:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>ASCII</command>. In this view you see the data from 
	    each end in ASCII, but alternating according to when each 
	    end sent data. Unfortunately, non-printing characters do not 
	    print.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>EBCDIC</command>. For the big-iron freaks out there.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>HEX Dump</command>. This allows you to see all the 
	    data, but you lose the ability to read it in ASCII.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <command>C Arrays</command>. This allows you to import the stream data
		into your own C program.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <note>
      <title>Note!</title>
      <para>
	It is worthwhile noting that Follow TCP Stream installs a filter 
	to select all the packets in the TCP stream you have selected.
      </para>
    </note>
  </section>
  </section>
  
  <section id="ChAdvReassemblySection"><title>Packet Reassembling</title>
    <section><title>What is it?</title>
    <para>
	Often network protocols needs to transport large chunks of data, which are 
	complete in itself, e.g. when transferring a file. The underlying 
	protocol might not be able to handle that chunk size (e.g. limitation of 
	the network packet size), or is stream-based like TCP, which doesn't know 
	data chunks at all.
    </para>
    <para>
	In that case the network protocol has to handle that chunks itself and 
	(if required) spreading the data over multiple packets. It also needs a 
	mechanism to find back the chunk boundaries on the receiving side.
    </para>
	<tip><title>Tip!</title>
    <para>
	Ethereal calls this mechanism reassembling, although a specific protocol  
	specification might use a different term for this.
	</para>
	</tip>
    </section>
    <section><title>How Ethereal handles it</title>
    <para>
	For some of the network protocols Ethereal knows of, a mechanism is 
	implemented to find, decode and display this chunks of data. 
	Ethereal will try to find the corresponding packets of this chunk, 
	and will show the combined data as additional pages in the 
	"Packet Bytes" pane, see <xref linkend="ChUsePacketBytesPaneSection"/>.
    </para>
    <note><title>Note!</title>
    <para>
	Reassembling might take place in several protocol layers, so it's possible 
	that multiple tabs in the "Packet Bytes" pane appear.
	</para>
    </note>
    <note><title>Note!</title>
    <para>
	You will find the reassembled data in the last packet of the chunk.
	</para>
    </note>
    <para>
	An example:
		In a <command>HTTP</command> GET response, the requested data (e.g. a 
		HTML page) is returned. Ethereal will show the hex dump of the data in 
		a new tab "Uncompressed entity body" in the "Packet Bytes" pane.
    </para>
    </section>
	
    <section><title>Reassembling is disabled!</title>
    <para>
	Reassembling is usually disabled in the preferences by default, as it 
	slows down packet processing a bit. 
    </para>
    <para>
	Enabling reassembling of a protocol typically requires two things:
	<orderedlist>
	<listitem>
    <para>
	the lower level protocol (e.g., TCP) must support
	reassembly. Often this reassembly can be enabled or disabled 
	via the protocol preferences.
    </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
    <para>
	the higher level protocol (e.g., HTTP) must use the
	reassembly mechanism to reassemble fragmented protocol data. This too
	can often be enabled or disabled via the protocol preferences.
    </para>
	</listitem>
	</orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
	The tooltip of the higher level protocol setting will note you if and 
	which lower level protocol setting has to be considered too.
    </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="ChAdvNameResolutionSection"><title>Name Resolution</title>
    <para>
	Name resolution tries to resolve some of the address values to human 
	readable names. This conversion might fail. For example, the name might be 
	unknown. Some of the lookups are done with data from your local 
	machine, while others asking network services such as DNS.
    </para>
    <para>
	XXX - add ipxnets name resolution explanation.
    </para>
    <note><title>Note!</title>
    <para>
	You might see packets to/from your machine in your capture file, which are
	caused by name resolution network services (e.g. DNS packets).
    </para>
    </note>
    <note><title>Note!</title>
    <para>
	The resolved names are not stored in the capture file or somewhere else, 
	so the resolved names might not be available if you open the capture file
	later or on another machine.
    </para>
    </note>
    <para>
	The name resolution feature can be en-/disabled separately for the 
	following protocol layers:
    </para>
	<section><title>MAC Layer</title>
    <para><command>ARP name resolution</command>
	Convert an ethernet address to the corresponding IP address 
	(e.g. 00:09:5b:01:02:03 -> 192.168.0.1). 
    </para>
    <para><command>Ethernet manufacturer codes</command>
	If the ARP name resolution failed, Ethereal tries to convert the first 3 
	bytes of an ethernet address to an abbreviated manufacturer name, which 
	has been assigned by the IETF (e.g. 00:09:5b:01:02:03 -> Netgear_01:02:03).
    </para>
	</section>
	<section><title>Network Layer</title>
    <para><command>DNS name resolution</command>
	Convert an IP address to the hostname associated with it 
	(e.g. 65.208.228.223 -> www.ethereal.com).
    </para>
	<warning>
	  <title>Warning!</title>
	  <para>
		Enabling network name resolution when your name server is 
		unavailable may significantly slow Ethereal while it waits 
		for all of the name server requests to time out. Use ADNS in that 
		case.
	  </para>
	</warning>	
	</section>
	<section><title>Transport Layer</title>
    <para><command>TCP/UDP port conversion</command>
	Convert a TCP or UDP port to its well known name (e.g. 80 -> http).
    </para>
	</section>
	<section><title>ADNS</title>
	<para>
	As noted, DNS lookups can significantly slow down Ethereal and make it 
	appear frozen, which can be very annoying. To solve this, Ethereal can use
	the ADNS library, which handles DNS calls asynchronously.
	</para>
