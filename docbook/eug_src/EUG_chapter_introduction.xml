    <title>What is <application>Ethereal?</application></title>
    <para>
	Ethereal is a network packet analyzer. A network packet 
	analyzer will try to capture network packets and tries to display
	that packet data as detailed as possible.
    </para>
    <para>
	You could think of a network packet analyzer as a measuring device used to 
	examine what's going on inside a network cable, just like a voltmeter is 
	used by an electrician to examine what's going on inside an electric cable 
	(but at a higher level, of course).
    </para>
    <para>
	In the past, such tools were either very expensive, proprietary, or both.
	However, with the advent of Ethereal, all that has changed.
    </para>
    <para>
	<application>Ethereal</application> is perhaps one of the best open 
	source packet analyzers available today.
	</para>

	<title>Live capture from many different network media</title>
	<para>
	  Despite its name, Ethereal can capture traffic from 
	  network media other than Ethernet. Which media types are 
	  supported, depends on many things like the operating system you are 
	  using. An overview of the supported media types can be found at:

	<title>Many protocol decoders</title>
	<para>
      There are protocol decoders (or dissectors, as they are 
      known in Ethereal) for a great many protocols:

	<section><title>Open Source Software</title>
    <para>
      Ethereal is an open source software project, and is released under 
      the <ulink url="&GPLWebsite;">GNU General Public Licence</ulink> (GPL). 
	  You can freely use Ethereal on any number of computers you like, without 
	  worrying about license keys or fees or such. In addition, all source 
	  code is freely available under the GPL. Because of that, it is very easy 
	  for people to add new protocols to Ethereal, either as plugins, or built 
	  into the source, and they often do!
    </para>
	</section>
	
    <section id="ChIntroNoFeatures"><title>What Ethereal is not</title>
	<para>
	Here are some things Ethereal does not provide:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	  Ethereal isn't an intrusion detection system.  It will not warn you when 
	  someone does strange things on your network that he/she isn't allowed to 
	  do. However, if strange things happen, Ethereal might help you figure 
	  out what is really going on.
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	  Ethereal will not manipulate things on the network, it will only 
	  "measure" things from it. Ethereal doesn't send packets on the network 
	  or do other active things (except for name resolutions, but even 
	  that can be disabled).

  <section id="ChIntroPlatforms">
    <title>Platforms Ethereal runs on</title>
    <para>
      Ethereal currently runs on most UNIX platforms and various Windows 
      platforms. It requires GTK+, GLib, libpcap and some other libraries in 
	  order to run.
    </para>
    <para>
      If a binary package is not available for your platform, you should 
      download the source and try to build it. Please report your experiences

      William Shakespeare wrote: 
      <emphasis>
	&quot;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&quot;
      </emphasis>  
      And so it is with Ethereal, as there appears to be two different 
      ways that people pronounce the name. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Some people pronounce it ether-real, while others pronounce it 
      e-the-real, as in ghostly, insubstantial, etc.

  <section id="ChIntroHistory">
    <title>A brief history of Ethereal</title>
    <para>
      In late 1997, Gerald Combs needed a tool for tracking down 
      networking problems and wanted to learn more about networking, so 
      he started writing Ethereal as a way to solve both problems.
    </para>
    <para>
      Ethereal was initially released, after several pauses in development, 
      in July 1998 as version 0.2.0.  Within days, patches, bug reports, 
      and words of encouragement started arriving, so Ethereal was on its 
      way to success.
    </para>
    <para>
      Not long after that Gilbert Ramirez saw its potential and contributed 
      a low-level dissector to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      In October, 1998, Guy Harris of Network Appliance was looking for 
	  something better than tcpview, so he started applying patches and 
	  contributing dissectors to Ethereal.
    </para>
    <para>
      In late 1998, Richard Sharpe, who was giving TCP/IP courses, saw its 
      potential on such courses, and started looking at it to see if it 
      supported the protocols he needed. While it didn't at that point, 
      new protocols could be easily added.  So he started contributing 
      dissectors and contributing patches.
    </para>
    <para>
      The list of people who have contributed to Ethereal has become very long 
	  since then, and almost all of them started with a protocol that they 
	  needed that Ethereal did not already handle. So they copied an existing 
	  dissector and contributed the code back to the team.

      Development and maintenance of <application>Ethereal</application>

      Ethereal was initially developed by Gerald Combs. Ongoing development

      group of individuals who fix bugs and provide new functionality.  
    </para>
    <para>
      There have also been a large number of people who have contributed 
      protocol dissectors to Ethereal, and it is expected that this will 
      continue.  You can find a list of the people who have contributed 
      code to Ethereal by checking the about dialog box of Ethereal, or at

	<section><title>Reporting Crashes on UNIX/Linux platforms</title>
    <para>
      When reporting crashes with Ethereal, it is helpful if you supply the 
      traceback information (besides the information mentioned in "Reporting 
	  Problems").
    </para>
	  <para>
	    You can obtain this traceback information with the following commands:
	    <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
$ gdb `whereis ethereal | cut -f2 -d: | cut -d' ' -f2` core >& bt.txt
backtrace
^D
$
]]>
		</programlisting>
	    <note>
	      <para>
		Type the characters in the first line verbatim! Those are 
		back-tics there!
	      </para>
	    </note>
	    <note>
	      <para>
		backtrace is a <command>gdb</command> command. You should 
		enter it verbatim after the first line shown above, but it will not be 
		echoed. The ^D 
		(Control-D, that is, press the Control key and the D key 
		together) will cause <command>gdb</command> to exit. This will 
		leave you with a file called 
		<filename>bt.txt</filename> in the current directory. 
		Include the file with your bug report.
	      </para>
	    </note>
	    <note>
	      <para>
		If you do not have <command>gdb</command> available, you 
		will have to check out your operating system's debugger.  
	      </para>
	    </note>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    You should mail the traceback to the 
		<ulink url="mailto:&EtherealDevMailList;">&EtherealDevMailList;</ulink>
	    mailing list.
	  </para>
  </section>
  
	<section><title>Reporting Crashes on Windows platforms</title>
    <para>
	The Windows distributions don't contain the symbol files (.pdb), because 
	they are very large. For this reason it's not possible to create 
	a meaningful backtrace file from it. You should report your crash just
	like other problems, using the mechanism described above.
