    <title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
	This chapter will provide you with information how to install and use 
	the various tools needed for Ethereal development.
	</para>
	<para>
	None of the tools mentioned in this chapter is needed to run Ethereal,
	they are only needed to build Ethereal.
	</para>
	<para>
	In the next chapters you will find explanations of the tool
	usage for some of the specific development tasks.
	</para>
	<para>
	Several different tools are needed to build Ethereal. These tools have
	their roots on unix like platforms, but win32 ports are also
	available. Therefore the tools are available in three different 
	"flavours":
	<itemizedlist>
  	<listitem>
	<para>
	Unix: as described above, the tools should be commonly available on the
	supported unix platforms, and through the cygwin unix emulation also for 
	win32 platforms
	</para>
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
	<para>
	Win32 native: native Win32 tools, no emulation required
	</para>
  	</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	Don't expect a lot of documentation regarding these tools in this
	document. If you need further documentation of a specific tool, you
	should find lot's of useful information elsewhere, as these tools are
	commonly used. The following will only do a very brief description of 
	what the particular tool is doing, how it is used in the Ethereal project 
	and how it can be installed and (rudimentary) tested.
	</para>
	<para>
	At the end of this chapter, some recommendations are given, for the
	easiest way to get your development platform up and running.
	</para>

	<section id="ChToolsCygwin">
	<title>Win32: Cygwin</title>
	<para>
	Cygwin provides a unix emulation layer with a lot of unix based tools
	on the win32 platform. Although cygwin consists of several
	seperate packages, the installation and update is done through only a
	single
	setup.exe, which acts similar like other unix package managers (like
	the RedHat Package Manager for example).
	</para>
	<para>
	You will find this network based setup.exe at: <ulink 
	url="http://www.cygwin.com/"/> click on one
	of the "Install Cygwin now" appearances, this will start the download
	of the setup.exe.
	</para>
	<para>
	After the download completed, start this setup.exe on your machine. It
	will ask you for some
	settings, the defaults should usually work well. The setup will
	then download and install a basic set of packages.
	</para>
	<para>
	Under: "Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Cygwin -&gt; Cygwin Bash Shell" you
	should now be able to start a new cygwin bash shell (similar to the
	command line in win32, but more powerful).
	</para>
	<para>
	If you want to add additional cygwin packages, you should start the
	setup.exe again, and select them in the packages window.
	</para>	
	</section>

	<section id="ChToolsBash">

	<para>
	Instead of using the the workspace (.dsw) and projects (.dsp) files,
	the	traditional nmake makefiles are used. This has one main reason: it
	makes it much easier to maintain changes simultaneous with the gcc
	toolchain makefile.am files as both file formats are similar. However, as
	no Visual Studio workspace/project files are available, this makes it
	hard to use the Visual Studio IDE e.g. for using the integrated
