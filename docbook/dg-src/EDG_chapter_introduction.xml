    <title>What is <application>Ethereal?</application></title>
    <para>
	Well, if you want to develop some things into Ethereal, you might already 
	know what Ethereal is doing. If not, please have a look at the 
	<ulink url="&LatestVersionWebsite;">Ethereal User's Guide</ulink>, 
	which will explain what Ethereal is doing and a lot more general 
	information about it.
    </para>
		
	<section><title>Open Source Software</title>
    <para>
      Ethereal is an open source software project, and is released under 
      the <ulink url="&GPLWebsite;">GNU General Public Licence</ulink> (GPL). 
	  You can freely use Ethereal on any number of computers you like, without 
	  worrying about license keys or fees or such. In addition, all source 
	  code is freely available under the GPL. Because of that, it is very easy 
	  for people to add new protocols to Ethereal, either as plugins, or built 
	  into the source, and they often do!
    </para>

  <section id="ChIntroPlatforms">
    <title>Platforms Ethereal runs on</title>
    <para>
      Ethereal currently runs on most UNIX platforms and various Windows 
      platforms. It requires GTK+, GLib, libpcap and some other libraries in 
	  order to run.
    </para>
    <para>
      If a binary package is not available for your platform, you should 
      download the source and try to build it. Please report your experiences
	  to <ulink url="mailto:&EtherealDevMailList;">&EtherealDevMailList;</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Binary packages are available for at least the following platforms:

  <section id="ChIntroDownload">
    <title>Where to get Ethereal?</title>
    <para>
      You can get the latest copy of the program from the Ethereal website: 
      <ulink url="&EtherealDownloadPage;">&EtherealDownloadPage;</ulink>.  The 
      website allows you to choose from among several mirrors for 
      downloading.
    </para>
    <para>
	A new Ethereal version will typically become available every 4-8 weeks.
    </para>
  </section>
    
  <section id="ChIntroHistory">
    <title>A brief history of Ethereal</title>
    <para>
      In late 1997, Gerald Combs needed a tool for tracking down 
      networking problems and wanted to learn more about networking, so 
      he started writing Ethereal as a way to solve both problems.
    </para>
    <para>
      Ethereal was initially released, after several pauses in development, 
      in July 1998 as version 0.2.0.  Within days, patches, bug reports, 
      and words of encouragement started arriving, so Ethereal was on its 
      way to success.
    </para>
    <para>
      Not long after that Gilbert Ramirez saw its potential and contributed 
      a low-level dissector to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      In October, 1998, Guy Harris of Network Appliance was looking for 
	  something better than tcpview, so he started applying patches and 
	  contributing dissectors to Ethereal.
    </para>
    <para>
      In late 1998, Richard Sharpe, who was giving TCP/IP courses, saw its 
      potential on such courses, and started looking at it to see if it 
      supported the protocols he needed. While it didn't at that point, 
      new protocols could be easily added.  So he started contributing 
      dissectors and contributing patches.
    </para>
    <para>
      The list of people who have contributed to Ethereal has become very long 
	  since then, and almost all of them started with a protocol that they 
	  needed that Ethereal did not already handle. So they copied an existing 
	  dissector and contributed the code back to the team.
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="ChIntroMaintenance">
    <title>
      Development and maintenance of <application>Ethereal</application>
    </title>
    <para>
      Ethereal was initially developed by Gerald Combs. Ongoing development 
      and maintenance of Ethereal is handled by the Ethereal team, a loose 
      group of individuals who fix bugs and provide new functionality.  
    </para>
    <para>
      There have also been a large number of people who have contributed 
      protocol dissectors to Ethereal, and it is expected that this will 
      continue.  You can find a list of the people who have contributed 
      code to Ethereal by checking the about dialog box of Ethereal, or at 
	  the <ulink url="&EtherealAuthorsPage;">authors</ulink> page on the 
      Ethereal web site.
    </para>
    <para>
      Ethereal is an open source software project, and is released under 
      the <ulink url="&GPLWebsite;">GNU General Public Licence</ulink> (GPL). 
	  All source code is freely available under the GPL.  You are welcome to 
      modify Ethereal to suit your own needs, and it would be appreciated 
      if you contribute your improvements back to the Ethereal team.
    </para>
    <para>
      You gain three benefits by contributing your improvements back to the 
      community:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Other people who find your contributions useful will appreciate 
	    them, and you will know that you have helped people in the 
	    same way that the developers of Ethereal have helped people.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The developers of Ethereal might improve your changes even more,
		as there's always room for improvements. Or they may implement some 
		advanced things on top of your code, which can be useful for yourself
		too.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The maintainers and developers of Ethereal will maintain your 
	    code as well, fixing it when API changes or other changes are 
	    made, and generally keeping it in tune with what is happening 
	    with Ethereal. So if Ethereal is updated (which is done often),
		you can get a new Ethereal version from the website and your changes 
		will already be included without any effort for you.

    </para>
    </note>
	You will find the FAQ inside Ethereal by clicking the menu item 
	Help/Contents and selecting the FAQ page in the upcoming dialog. 
    </para>
    <para>
	An online version is available at the ethereal website:
	<ulink url="&EtherealFAQPage;">&EtherealFAQPage;</ulink>. You might 
	prefer this online version, as it's typically more up to date and the HTML 
	format is easier to use.
    </para>
	</section>
	
	<section id="ChIntroMailingLists"><title>Mailing Lists</title>
    <para>
      There are several mailing lists of specific Ethereal topics available:
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term><command>ethereal-announce</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This mailing list will inform you about new program 
		  releases, which usually appear about every 4-8 weeks.

	Before reporting any problems, please make sure you have installed the 
	latest version of Ethereal.
	</para>
	</note>
    <para>
      When reporting problems with Ethereal, it is helpful if you supply the 
      following information:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The version number of Ethereal and the dependent libraries linked with 
		it, eg GTK+, etc. You can obtain this with the command 
	    <command>ethereal -v</command>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Information about the platform you run Ethereal on.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    A detailed description of your problem.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
	<note><title>Don't send large files!</title>
	<para>
	Do not send large files (>100KB) to the mailing lists, just place a note 
	that further data is available on request. Large files will only annoy a 
	lot of people on the list who are not interested in your specific problem. 
	If required, you will be asked for further data by the persons who really 
	can help you.
	</para>
	</note>
	<note><title>Don't send confidential information!</title>
	<para>
	If you send captured data to the mailing lists, be sure they don't contain 
	any sensitive or confidential information like passwords or such.

	<section><title>Reporting Crashes on UNIX/Linux platforms</title>
    <para>
      When reporting crashes with Ethereal, it is helpful if you supply the 
      traceback information (besides the information mentioned in "Reporting 
	  Problems").
    </para>
	  <para>
	    You can obtain this traceback information with the following commands:
	    <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
$ gdb `whereis ethereal | cut -f2 -d: | cut -d' ' -f2` core >& bt.txt
backtrace
^D
$
]]>
		</programlisting>
	    <note>
	      <para>
		Type the characters in the first line verbatim! Those are 
		back-tics there!
	      </para>
	    </note>
	    <note>
	      <para>
		backtrace is a <command>gdb</command> command. You should 
		enter it verbatim after the first line shown above, but it will not be 
		echoed. The ^D 
		(Control-D, that is, press the Control key and the D key 
		together) will cause <command>gdb</command> to exit. This will 
		leave you with a file called 
		<filename>bt.txt</filename> in the current directory. 
		Include the file with your bug report.
	      </para>
	    </note>
	    <note>
	      <para>
		If you do not have <command>gdb</command> available, you 
		will have to check out your operating system's debugger.  
	      </para>
	    </note>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    You should mail the traceback to the 
		<ulink url="mailto:&EtherealDevMailList;">&EtherealDevMailList;</ulink>
	    mailing list.
	  </para>
  </section>
  
	<section><title>Reporting Crashes on Windows platforms</title>
    <para>
	The Windows distributions don't contain the symbol files (.pdb), because 
	they are very large. For this reason it's not possible to create 
	a meaningful backtrace file from it. You should report your crash just
	like other problems, using the mechanism described above.
    </para>
