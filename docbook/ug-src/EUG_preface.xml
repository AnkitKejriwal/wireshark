    Ethereal is one of those programs that many network managers would love 
    to be able to use, but they are often prevented from getting what they 
    would like from Ethereal because of the lack of documentation.
  </para>
  <para>
    This document is part of an effort by the Ethereal team to improve the 
	usability of Ethereal.
  </para>
  <para>
    We hope that you find it useful, and look forward to your comments.

  <title>Who should read this document?</title>
  <para>
  The intended audience of this book is anyone using Ethereal.
  </para>
  <para>
  This book will explain all the basics and also some of the advanced features 
  that Ethereal provides. As Ethereal has become a very complex program since 
  the early days, not every feature of Ethereal might be explained in this 
  book. 
  </para>
  <para>
  This book is not intended to explain network sniffing in general and it will
  not provide details about specific network protocols. However, as this book
  evolves in time (like Ethereal itself), this might change in the future.
  </para>
  <para>
  By reading this book, you will learn how to install Ethereal, how to use the 
  basic elements of the graphical user interface (like the menu) and what's 
  behind some of the advanced features that are maybe not that obvious at first 
  sight. It will 
  hopefully guide you around some common problems that frequently appears for 
  new (and sometimes even advanced) users of Ethereal.
