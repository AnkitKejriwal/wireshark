      As with all things, there must be a beginning, and so it is with 
      Ethereal. To use Ethereal, you must:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Obtain a binary package for your operating system, or

      Currently, only two or three Linux distributions ship ethereal, and 
      they are commonly shipping an out-of-date version.  No other versions 
      of UNIX ship Ethereal so far, and Microsoft does not ship it with any 
      version of Windows.  For that reason, you will need to know where to 
      get the latest version of Ethereal and how to install it.
    </para>
    <para>
      This chapter shows you how to obtain source and binary packages, 
      and how to build Ethereal from source, should you choose to do so.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following are the general steps you would use:
      <orderedlist>

	    Download the relevant package for your needs, e.g. source or 
	    binary distribution.
	  </para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Build the source into a binary, if you have downloaded the 
	    source.

    <title>Obtaining the source and binary distributions</title>
    <para>
      You can obtain both source and binary distributions from the Ethereal 
      web site: <ulink url="&EtherealWebSite;">&EtherealWebSite;</ulink>. 
      Simply select the download link, and then select either the source 
      package or binary package of your choice from the mirror site closest 
      to you.
    </para>
    <note>
      <title>Download all the needed files</title>
      <para>
	In general, unless you have already downloaded Ethereal 
	before, you will most likely need to download several source 
	packages if you are building Ethereal from source.  This is 
	covered in more detail below. <!-- Make a ref -->
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Once you have downloaded the relevant files, you can go on to the 
      next step.
    </para>
    <note>
      <title>Note!</title>
      <para>
	While you will find a number of binary packages available on the 
	Ethereal web site, you might not find one for your platform, and 
	they often tend to be several versions behind the current released 
	version, as they are contributed by people who have the platforms 
	they are built for.
      </para>
      <para>
	For this reason, you might want to pull down the source distribution 
	and build it, as the process is relatively simple.

    <title>Before you build <application>Ethereal</application></title>
    <para>
      Before you build Ethereal from sources, or install a binary package, 
      you must ensure that you have the following other packages installed:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>GTK+, The GIMP Tool Kit.</para>
	  <para>
	    You will also need Glib.  Both can be obtained from 
	    <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org">www.gtk.org</ulink>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    libpcap, the packet capture software that Ethereal uses.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    You can obtain libpcap from 
	    <ulink url="http://www.tcpdump.org">www.tcpdump.org</ulink>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Depending on your system, you may be able to install these from 
      binaries, e.g. RPMs, or you may need to obtain them in source code 
      form and build them.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you have downloaded the source for GTK+, the instructions shown 
      in <xref linkend="Ch02Ex1"/> may provide some help in building it:
	<example id="Ch02Ex1">

	    You may need to change the version number of gtk+ in 
	    <xref linkend="Ch02Ex1"/> to match the version of GTK+ you have 
	      downloaded. The directory you change to will change if the 
	      version of GTK+ changes, and in all cases,

      Under RedHat 6.x and beyond (and distributions based on it, like 
      Mandrake) you can simply install each of the packages you need from 
      RPMs. Most Linux systems will install GTK+ and Glib in anycase, 
      however, you will probably need to install the devel versions of 
      each of these packages. The commands shown in <xref linkend="Ch02Ex4"/> 
	will install all the needed RPMs if they are not already installed.

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Unpack the source from its <command>gzip</command>'d

    <title>Installing the binaries under UNIX</title>
    <para>
      In general, installing the binary under your version of UNIX will be 
      specific to the installation methods used with your version of UNIX.  
      For example, under AIX, you would use <command>smit</command> to 
      install the Ethereal binary package, while under Tru64 UNIX 
      (formerly Digital UNIX) you would use <command>setld</command>.

    <title>Installing from rpm's under RedHat and alike</title>
    <para>
      Use the following command to install the Ethereal RPM that you have

      <programlisting>
rpm -ivh ethereal-0.10.5-0.2.2.i386.rpm
      </programlisting>
      If the above step fails because of missing dependencies, install the

    <title>Troubleshooting during the install on Unix</title>
    <para>
      A number of errors can occur during the installation process.  
      Some hints on solving these are provided here.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the <command>configure</command> stage fails, you will need to find 
      out why. You can check the file <filename>config.log</filename> in the 
      source directory to find out what failed. The last few lines of this 
      file should help in determining the problem.
    </para>
    <para>
      The standard problems are that you do not have GTK+ on your system, 
      or you do not have a recent enough version of GTK+. The 
      <command>configure</command> will also fail if you do not have libpcap 
      (at least the required include files) on your system.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another common problem is for the final compile and link stage to 
      terminate with a complaint of: <errorname>Output too long.</errorname>  
      This is likely to be caused by an antiquated <command>sed</command> 
      (such as the one shipped with Solaris).  Since <command>sed</command> is 
      used by the <command>libtool</command> script to construct the final 
      link command, this leads to mysterious problems.  This can be 
      resolved by downloading a recent version of sed from 
      <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/directory/sed.html">
	http://www.gnu.org/directory/sed.html
      </ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you cannot determine what the problems are, send mail to the 
      <command>ethereal-dev</command> mailing list explaining your problem, 
      and including the output from <filename>config.log</filename> and 
      anything else you think is relevant, like a trace of the 
      <command>make</command> stage.

      In this section we explore installing Ethereal under Windows from the 
      binary packages.  You must follow two steps:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Install WinPcap. You will find a single installer exe called something 
		like "auto-installer", which can be installed under various Windows 
		systems, including 9x/Me/NT4.0/2000/XP. This installer is located at: 
	    <ulink url="&WinPcapDownloadWebsite;">&WinPcapDownloadWebsite;</ulink>.
	    You should download the latest released version (the latest one not 
		marked "beta") and execute it. 
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Install Ethereal. You may acquire a binary installable of 
	    Ethereal at

	    Download the installer and execute it.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
	  Both steps are extremely simply, as you only have to download and

  <section id="ChBuildInstallWinUpdate">
    <title>Update</title>
	<para>
	From time to time you may want to update your installed Ethereal to a more

	<listitem>
    <para>
    <command>Update WinPcap</command>.
	New versions of WinPcap are less frequently available, maybe only once a
