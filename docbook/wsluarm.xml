      Wireshark has an embedded Lua interpreter. Lua is a powerful light-weight
	  programming language designed for extending applications. Lua is designed
	  and implemented by a team at PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University
	  of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Lua was born and raised at Tecgraf, the
	  Computer Graphics Technology Group of PUC-Rio, and is now housed at Lua.org.
	  Both Tecgraf and Lua.org are laboratories of the Department of Computer Science.

	<para>
	   In Wireshark Lua can be used to write dissectors and taps. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  Wireshark's Lua interpreter starts by loading <command>init.lua</command> that
	  is located in the global configuration directory of Wireshark.
	  Lua is disabled by default by setting the variable <command>disable_lua</command>
	  to true in <command>init.lua</command>. To enable lua the line that sets that variable
	  must be removed or commented out.
	</para>
	<para>
	  After loading <command>init.lua</command> from the data directory if lua is enabled
	  Wireshark will try to load a file named <command>init.lua</command> in the user's
	  directory.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The command line option <command>-X lua_script:&lt;file.lua&gt;</command> can be used to
	  load lua scripts as well.	  
	</para>
	<para>
	  The Lua code will be executed once after all the protocols have being initialized and before reading
	  any file.
