Here's a brief list of information that might be useful to anyone
distributing a software package containing Wireshark:

1.  The canonical location for every Wireshark source release is

    http://www.wireshark.org/download/src/all-versions/, e.g.

    http://www.wireshark.org/download/src/all-versions/wireshark-0.99.55.tar.bz2

    If your packaging system downloads a copy of the Wireshark sources,
    use this location.  Don't use http://www.wireshark.org/download/src.

2.  The Wireshark web site URL is http://www.wireshark.org/ .

3.  Wireshark is released under the GNU General Public License.  Make sure
    your package complies with this license, or we send in the marmots.

4.  Wireshark and the "fin" logo are registered trademarks of Gerald
    Combs.

5.  Custom version information can be added by creating a file called
    "version.conf".  See make-version.pl for details.  If your package
    contains significant changes we recommend that you use this to
    differentiate it from official Wireshark releases.

6.  Wireshark icons, logos, and other artwork can be found in the
    "image" directory of the Wireshark sources.

7.  Wireshark is spelled with a capital "W", and with everything else
    lower case.  E.g., "WireShark" is incorrect.

If you have a question not addressed here, send it to
wireshark-dev@wireshark.org.
