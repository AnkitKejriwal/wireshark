Status of the GTK+ 2.0 port :
---------------------------

GtkList and GtkCList ==> GtkTreeView conversion :
- color_dlg.c
- column_prefs.c : done
- decode_as_dlg.c : done
- dfilter_expr_dialog.c
- filter_prefs.c : done
- main.c
- plugins_dlg.c : done

GtkCTree ==> GtkTreeView  conversion : done

GtkText ==> GtkTextView conversion : done

Remaining problems :

- gtk_font_selection_dialog_set_filter doesn't exist anymore (but hasn't
  been removed from the documentation).  There is no way to filter the
  font selection to get only fixed width fonts; in a message at

	http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2002-July/msg00202.html

  Owen Taylor explains why Pango (and hence GTK+ 2.0) doesn't know what
  fonts are fixed-width and what fonts aren't:

	Give us code that can distinguish reliably between monospaced and
	not-monospaced fonts for Type1 and TrueType fonts and at that
	point it becomes reasonable to think about such an API. It's
	not all that easy to do.

	Even then, there are still problems - Pango by default will
	draw characters not in the main font using fallback fonts --
	whose metrics almost certainly don't match your grid. So,
	you'd have to be able to turn this off.

- we have to remove GUI prefs which are not useful anymore, such as the
  tree line style and tree expander style.  Those two items aren't
  settable in GTK+ 2.0's new tree view widget, as the GTK+ developers
  consider them per-user preferences rather than items that should be
  set by individual applications.

- double click on item in protocol tree doesn't expand or collapse its
  subtree ;

- the spacing between lines in the tree view is too big ;

- merge gtk and gtk2 directories. Create a gtk12 directory if necessary.
