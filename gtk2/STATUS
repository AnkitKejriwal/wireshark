Status of the GTK+ 2.0 port :
---------------------------

GtkList and GtkCList ==> GtkTreeView conversion :
- color_dlg.c
- column_prefs.c : done
- decode_as_dlg.c : done
- dfilter_expr_dialog.c
- filter_prefs.c : done
- main.c
- plugins_dlg.c : done

GtkCTree ==> GtkTreeView  conversion : done

GtkText ==> GtkTextView conversion : done

Remaining problems :

- gtk_font_selection_dialog_set_filter doesn't exist anymore (but hasn't
  been removed from the documentation). I don't know how to filter the
  font selection dialog to get only fixed width fonts ;

- we have to remove GUI prefs which are not usefule anymore : tree line
  style and tree expander style ;

- double click on item in protocol tree doesn't expand or collapse its
  subtree ;

- the spacing between lines in the tree view is too big ;

- merge gtk and gtk2 directories. Create a gtk12 directory if necessary.
