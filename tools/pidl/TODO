- EJS output backend shouldn't use the NDR levels stuff but instead 
  as the "C levels" and NDR levels don't necessarily match.

- true multiple dimension array / strings in arrays support

- compatibility mode for generating MIDL-readable data:
 - strip out pidl-specific properties

- support nested elements
 - allow non-typedef structs
 - generate names for anonymous tagged types. Simple MD5Sum of contents?
 - support typedefs properly
 - improve represent_as(): allow it to be used for arrays and other complex 
   types

- --explain-ndr option that dumps out parse tree ?

- seperate tables for NDR and DCE/RPC

- allow data structures outside of interfaces

- mem_ctx in the interface rather than as struct ndr member.

- real typelibs

- fix [in,out] handling and allocation for samba3:
 - add inout
 - make NULL to mean "allocate me"
 - remove NDR_AUTO_REF_ALLOC flag

- automatic test generator based on IDL pointer types
