This tree is a convenience copy of
svn://svnanon.samba.org/samba/branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/pidl
to allow building Ethereal pidl dissectors without having to
access a remove svn repository.

Don't do changes here, do them at the samba tree!

In order to build, install yapp (on Suse, the rpm is named perl-Parse-Yapp),
then do
make Makefile.PL && make

run 

blib/pidl --eth-parser -- <idl-file>
