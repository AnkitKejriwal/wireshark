The REAMDE specific to the Ethereal copy of the pidl sources
============================================================

This tree is a convenience copy of
svn://svnanon.samba.org/samba/branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/pidl
to allow building Ethereal pidl dissectors without having to
access a remote svn repository.

Don't do changes here, do them at the samba tree! Changes to this tree will
be overwritten the next time the sources from the samba tree are synced.

In order to build, install yapp (on Suse, the rpm is named perl-Parse-Yapp),
then do
make Makefile.PL && make && make doc && make install

Note: This will not install the manpage (pidl.1). If you know how to do that
please send the info to ethereal-dev@ethereal.com
Note2: In order for "make doc" to succeed, you will need
  a) xsltproc and
  b) Internet access or a proper redirect to local copies of the manpages/docbook.xsl
     and html/docbook.xsl files.

run  pidl with:

pidl --eth-parser -- <idl-file>  (don't forget the "--")

This *will* result in a warning like:
atsvc.idl:5:23: idl_types.h: No such file or directory
and *may* result in additional warnings like:
Warning: No conformance file `initshutdown.cnf'
Unable to handle string with flags STR_LEN4|STR_NOTERM at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/Parse/Pidl/Ethereal/NDR.pm line 283.
