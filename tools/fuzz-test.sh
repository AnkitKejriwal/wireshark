# Fuzz-testing script for Tethereal
#
# This script uses Editcap to add random errors ("fuzz") to a set of
# capture files specified on the command line.  It runs Tethereal on
# each fuzzed file and checks for errors.  The files are processed
# repeatedly until an error is found.

# Tweak the following to your liking.  Editcap must support "-E".
TETHEREAL=./tethereal
EDITCAP=./editcap
CAPINFOS=./capinfos

# This needs to point to a 'date' that supports %s.
DATE=/bin/date

# Where our temp files are saved (editcap.out and stderr.out)
# (had problems with this on cygwin, tried TMP_DIR=./ which worked)
TMP_DIR=/tmp

# These may be set to your liking
# Stop the child process, if it's running longer than x seconds
MAX_CPU_TIME=900
# Stop the child process, if it's using more than y * 1024 bytes
MAX_VMEM=500000
# Insert z times an error into the capture file (0.02 seems to be a good value to find errors)
ERR_PROB=0.02

# set some limits to the child processes, e.g. stop it if it's running longer then MAX_CPU_TIME seconds
# (ulimit is not supported well on cygwin and probably other platforms, e.g. cygwin shows some warnings)
ulimit -S -t $MAX_CPU_TIME -v $MAX_VMEM
