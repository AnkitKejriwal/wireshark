	* gtk/capture_dlg.c:

	  In get_if_name(), return immediately once we've found our
	  interface name under Windows.

2004-02-24 01:14  guy

	* version_info.c:

	  Put a period at the end of the "Running with" stuff.

2004-02-24 01:11  guy

	* pcap-util.c:

	  Squelch a compiler warning.

2004-02-23 23:13  guy

	* gtk/capture_dlg.c:

	  Sigh.  On Windows OT, device names don't have "\Device\" in front
	  of them, so we can't look for "\Device\" as the beginning of the
	  interface name.  Instead, on Windows, scan backwards for a colon
	  and then skip the colon and any subsequent blanks.  (I don't
	  *think* interface names have colons in them in Windows, even on
	  NT 5.x with the GUID crapola in the name.)

	  gtk/hostlist_table.c, gtk/main.c, gtk/main.h,
	  gtk/rtp_stream_dlg.c, gtk/service_response_time_table.c:

	  Add a "force" argument to "filter_packets()" and
	  "main_filter_packets()", to force the filtering to be done even
	  if the filter is the same as the current one; this is necessary
	  in order to make sure "Follow TCP Stream" gets the packets
	  processed even if you're filtering the stream that's currently
	  filtered in.

2004-02-23 22:45  gerald

	* Makefile.common, Makefile.nmake:

	  MSVC doesn't like having header files in .c=.obj targets.  Fix
	  dftest compiling under Windows.

2004-02-23 22:26  ulfl

	* gtk/io_stat.c:

	  changed title and menu registering to "IO Graphs" and changed

2004-02-23 22:23  ulfl

	* gtk/tcp_graph.c:

	  minor change

2004-02-23 21:14  gerald

	* Makefile.common:

	  Move x11-declarations.h and x11-register-info.h back into

	  Changed all items to "Endpoint List" and get rid of the "Host
	  List" group.	called "IO stats" now "Throughput Graph" as this
	  might be somewhat more descriptive IMHO.  Same applies to the
	  "TCP Stream Analysis" -> "TCP Stream Graphs"

2004-02-23 17:38  obiot

	* prefs.c:

	  Use a pale variant of the foreground color for the background
	  color of the follow TCP stream data display. As a result, we can
	  now make the distinction between real data and whitespace
	  wrapping by the UI.

2004-02-23 16:33  jmayer

	* AUTHORS, packet-nt-sonmp.c, packet-nt-tpcp.c, doc/ethereal.pod:

	  Change Email address of Giles Scott

2004-02-23 16:12  gerald

	* Makefile.common, tethereal.c, gtk/main.c:

	  Move cvsversion.h from BUILT_INCLUDES to BUILT_SOURCES.  This
	  tells automake to create cvsversion.h before any "all" or "check"
	  targets are built.

	  Clean up a few CVS version strings that I missed last week.

	  update to kerberos.	now also decrypting the KRB_PRIB blobs
	  (application 21) of kerberos v5.  there are commonly found in

	  Not too interesting yet until we start supporting decryption of

	  "endpoints" instead of "conv".

	  Similarly, make the titles for their windows say "Hosts" or

2004-02-23 04:16  sharpe

2004-02-22 22:45  guy

	* epan/value_string.h:

	  From Peter J. Creath: add a convenience macro for value_string

	* make-tapreg-dotc:

	  Redesigned the menu structure of the former statistics stuff, now

2004-02-22 09:07  jmayer

	  build randpkt similar to dftest

2004-02-22 08:30  ulfl

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.common, Makefile.nmake:

	  make the Makefile.common really common between automake and

2004-02-22 03:04  gram

	* epan/dfilter/semcheck.c, epan/ftypes/ftype-tvbuff.c,

	  relation that is expressed in the display filter.

	  Note that tvbuff's *should* be able to participate in ==

2004-02-21 22:54  ulfl

	* gtk/capture_dlg.c:

2004-02-21 22:00  guy

	* dftest.c:

	  Get rid of some "#if 0"ed out #includes.

	  Define "report_open_failure()" and "report_read_failure()", so
	  that dissectors can report file open and read errors.

2004-02-21 14:04  ulfl

	* capture.c:

	  bugfix from previous check in

2004-02-21 13:40  ulfl

2004-02-21 12:58  ulfl

	* capture.c, capture.h, file.c, gtk/capture_info_dlg.c:

	  rework of capture.c: better seperation of sync and capture pipe

	  do_capture(), but no functional change!

2004-02-21 11:38  guy

	* plugins/plugin_api.h:

2004-02-21 10:29  guy

	* packet-diameter.c:

	  Make both the Diameter-over-TCP and Diameter-over-SCTP dissectors
	  "new-style" dissectors, and have them reject packets that don't
	  start with a version number of 1, in the hopes that it'll be less
	  likely to try to dissect non-Diameter packets to/from port 1812
	  as Diameter and thus less likely to spew out a bunch of warnings
	  that cause users to ask the Ethereal mailing lists what the
	  problem is.

	  Use "tcp_dissect_pdus()" to handle Diameter-over-TCP.

	  Re-do fix for Jaime Fournier's e-mail address.

2004-02-21 09:57  guy

	* packet-dcerpc.c:

	  From Jaime Fournier:

		  The UNKUUID col_info update was only working as
		  dcerpc_try_handoff() would fail to find the subdissector,
	  and
		  thus did not clobber it with col_add_str().  It is now in
	  the
		  right place to determine a UUID that was either not
	  found, or is
		  disabled.  The boolean dcerpc.unknown_if_id is now only
	  set on
		  cases where the handoff fails.  This has been tested, and
	  the
		  boolean now works as it should, and is not set for ALL
	  packets
		  as it was in the old location.

2004-02-21 09:49  guy

	* packet-dcerpc-rs_pgo.c:

	  Update from Jaime Fournier.

2004-02-21 08:21  guy

	* packet-rpl.c:

	  When constructing a tvbuff for an RPL packet, arrange that both

	  actual lengths remaining in the packet and on the length field.

2004-02-21 07:59  guy

	* prefs.c:

	  Fix a typo.

2004-02-21 05:12  guy

	* packet-ethertype.c, packet-ieee8023.c:

	  Save the current_proto value before calling subdissectors, and
	  restore it if we catch an exception (after showing the
	  exception), so that subsequent exceptions will have the right
	  protocol.

2004-02-21 04:55  guy

	* packet-dcerpc-fldb.c:

	  From Jaime Fournier:

		  properly handle the name string in a KerbPrin in a

		  dispaly name sizes in decimal rather than hex.

2004-02-21 04:26  guy

2004-02-21 02:20  guy

	* plugins/plugin_api_list.c:

	* Makefile.common, alert_box.c, file.c, report_err.h, tethereal.c,
	  plugins/plugin_api_list.c, plugins/asn1/packet-asn1.c:

	  Add routines that can be called from dissectors to report file
	  open and read errors; there are separate implementations for
	  Ethereal (pops up an alert box) and Tethereal (prints an error
	  message).

	  Use those routines in the ASN.1 dissector.

2004-02-21 01:31  guy

	* packet-http.c:

	  Get the Content-Encoding and Transfer-Encoding headers and, for
	  now, don't try to dissect the body if there's any special
	  encoding.

2004-02-21 00:33  guy

	* packet-ethertype.c:

	  Handle exceptions the same way we handle them in the DCE RPC
	  dissector - rethrow BoundsError, call "show_exception()" for all
	  other errors, and then fall through to dissect the trailer
	  outside the TRY/CATCH/ENDRY construct.

	  turned out not to be the cause of the problem I saw wherein
	  recent versions of Ethereal were popping up the main window in an

	  Don't use C++style comments.

	  Clean up indentation.

2004-02-20 22:32  guy

2004-02-20 20:36  gerald

	* make-version.pl, mergecap.c, tethereal.c, gtk/main.c:

	  Add support for a "version.conf" file in the main directory which

	  configuration directives: "enable", which can be 0 or 1, and
	  "format", which can be any strftime()-compatible string, e.g.

	* packet-ieee8023.c:

	  Handle the case where, after an exception is thrown dissecting
	  the body of the 802.3 packet, we get *another* exception when
	  dissecting the trailer (consider a truncated frame with a
	  malformed body).

	* Makefile.common, packet-ber.c, packet-ber.h, packet-kerberos.c:

	  Update to Kerberos.  Split kerberos prototype into two halves:
	  helpers to dissect ASN.1 BER in packet-ber.c and kerberos stuff
	  using those helpers in packet-kerberos.c

	  This new kerberos thing places filterable items for every single
	  field and also dissects the bitstring Option fields.

	  It is hoped that this will make it easier to extend kerberos to
	  do decryption of service tickets.

	* gtk/hostlist_table.c:

	  FN_{SRC,DST}_ADDRESS and FN_{SRC,DST}_PORT aren't used - get rid
	  of them.

	  Add support for "Find Frame" and "Colorize Host Traffic" menus,
	  similar to what the endpoint table has.

	* packet-tds.c:

	  In the columns list in a results token, columns with a type of

	* plugins/asn1/packet-asn1.c:

	  On Win32, don't treat "file not found" as an error when trying to
	  load the ASN.1 file if the pathname is the old default file
	  pathname, with the last component preceded by "/" rather than
	  "\", to suppress complaints if you have a preferences file saved
	  under the old regime.
