	* plugins/: Xass-list, Xplugin_api.c, Xplugin_api.h,
	  Xplugin_api_decls.h, Xplugin_table.h:

	  Update for Tomas Kukosa's new APIs to get the parent and the
	  nth-grandparent-up for a protocol tree item and to get the last
	  item created by the BER dissector (that API and the new names for
	  the universal tags were supplied by him - the checkin item didn't
	  give him credit).

2004-03-26 00:00  guy

	* packet-kerberos.c:

	  From Tomas Kukosa: use the "proto_item_get_parent()" and
	  "proto_item_get_parent_nth()" routines, and use the new name for
	  some of the constants for universal tags.

2004-03-25 23:59  guy

2004-03-25 23:57  guy

	* packet-ber.c, packet-ber.h:

	  Add constants and names for all universal tags.

	  Add "get_ber_last_created_item()" to get the last created item -
	  you can't access the global variable from a plugin.

2004-03-25 23:55  guy

	* epan/proto.c, epan/proto.h, plugins/plugin_api_list.c:

	  Make "epan_init()" take, as additional arguments, pointers to

	  errors, and have "report_open_failure()" and
	  "report_read_failure()" call through those pointers, rather than
	  being defined and exported by the application using libethereal -
	  instead, the application would define those functions and pass
	  pointers to them to 'epan_init()".

	  Move "report_err.h" to the epan directory, as the functions it
	  declares are now part of the libethereal API.

	  Zero-length arrays are *not* valid in C89, even if GCC doesn't

2004-03-23 18:33  tuexen

	* README.macos:

	  pcap-stdinc.h is not needed on a Mac OS X system.

2004-03-23 18:06  guy

	* packet-cdp.c, epan/tvbuff.c, epan/tvbuff.h:

	  Use "tvb_format_text()" to display strings, so we handle
	  non-printable characters.

	  Some strings appear to be null-padded; add a
	  "tvb_format_stringzpad()" routine to handle them, so that we
	  don't show the padding characters as "\000".

2004-03-23 18:04  tuexen

	* packet-sctp.c:

	  Add tap functionality.

2004-03-23 18:03  guy

	* packet-x11.c:

	  Handle the case where the keycodemap entry for one of the
	  keycodes processed in the first loop in "keycode2keysymString()"
	  is null.  I don't know whether the right thing to do is to give
	  up (as we're doing now) or to not check that map.

	  In that routine, we set "syms" to "keycodemap[keycode]", and give
	  up if it's null; use "syms" in that routine instead of
	  "keycodemap[keycode]", so we know that those places don't have to
	  worry about "keycodemap[keycode]" being null.

	  Fix up indentation.

2004-03-23 18:02  tuexen

	* Makefile.common:

2004-03-23 17:27  tuexen

	  selected.

2004-03-23 07:40  guy

	* x11-fields:

	  "keys" is a LISTofCARD8, so it should have type BYTES, not UINT8.

2004-03-23 07:39  guy

	* packet-aim.c:

	  Get rid of a no-longer-used argument.

2004-03-23 07:23  guy

	* packet-aim.c:

	  The dissectors for particular AIM families aren't for real
	  protocols, and they don't create their own subtrees; hand them
	  the pointer to the AIM subtree, rather than the top-level tree,
	  so they'll put the protocol tree items in the AIM subtree.

2004-03-23 06:48  guy

2004-03-23 03:19  guy

	* README.macos:

	  Note that you need X11 and the X11 developer headers and
	  libraries installed in order to build Ethereal.

	  Michael Tuexen indicated how to successfully build GTK+ 2.4 on
	  Mac OS X (10.3[.x], at least) - update the directions to give the
	  latest versions of GLib/Pango/GTK+/ATK and to give instructions
	  on how to make them build.

2004-03-23 01:58  guy

	* packet-ipv6.c:

	  The "len" argument to capture routines should not be decremented
	  as you move through the packet - it's the total length of
	  captured data.

2004-03-23 01:29  guy

	* packet-ucp.c:

	  If we don't find a trailing / in a parameter, throw the

2004-03-23 00:17  guy

	* wiretap/eyesdn.c:

2004-03-22 23:50  guy

	* README.macos:

	  To build with GLib 2.x/GTK+ 2.x, you need to configure with
	  --enable-gtk2 regardless of whether you have GLib 1.2[.x]/GTK+
	  1.2[.x] installed or not.

2004-03-22 23:40  guy

	* README.macos:

	  Note that GTK+ 2.4 doesn't work, and indicate why.

	  Enumerate the dependencies for GLib 2.4/GTK+ 2.4, and indicate
	  that GNU gettext is also required, even though it's not in the
	  set of dependencies on the GTK+ site (after all, the ENTIRE WORLD
	  runs Linux, RIGHT?).

	  Give a (partial) order for the dependencies.

	  Note some issues with building and installing the JPEG and libpng
	  libraries.

	  * X11 dissector:

	  - in decoding of replies: 0 is not an unknown opcode, it means
	  that the   request was unseen or that the opcode of the request
	  is unknown   (e.g. due to unseen / undecoded QueryExtension
	  replies)

	  - add special processing for QueryExtension requests & replies in
	  order to   store new opcodes in a value_string of opcodes saved
	  per conversation

	  - try to resynchronize sequence number once at first reply if no
	  initial   connection request was seen

	  - add decoding of SendEvent request

	  - add decoding of many replies (AllocColor, GetInputFocus,
	  GetGeometry,	 GetPointerControl, GetScreenSaver,
	  GetSelectionOwner, GrabKeyboard,   GrabPointer, InternAtom,
	  ListProperties, LookupColor, QueryBestSize,	QueryKeymap,
	  QueryPointer, TranslateCoordinates)

	  - fix decoding of EnterNotify / LeaveNotify events

	  - add decoding of most events (FocusIn, FocusOut, Expose,
	  GraphicsExpose,   NoExpose, VisibilityNotify, CreateNotify,
	  DestroyNotify, UnmapNotify,	MapNotify, MapRequest,
	  ReparentNotify, ConfigureNotify, GravityNotify,   ResizeRequest,

2004-03-22 01:18  guy

	* packet-cdp.c:

	  Fix a typo.

2004-03-21 23:46  guy

	* packet-3g-a11.c:

	  The CDMA2000 A11 dissector doesn't put anything into the protocol
	  tree for a packet with an unknown type, so we make it just reject
	  those packets so other dissectors can claim them.

2004-03-21 23:19  guy

	* packet-diameter.c:

	  Clean up white space.

	  Just use "proto_tree_add_item()" to put the session ID into the
	  protocol string.

2004-03-21 23:10  guy

	* packet-diameter.c:

	  From Anders Broman: fix the value strings for decoding of AVP

	  fields, and add some more field types.

2004-03-21 23:08  guy

	* packet-diameter-defs.h:

	  From Anders Broman: add some more AVP's, result codes, etc..

2004-03-21 22:55  guy

	* README.macos:

	  Update to note that the 10.3.3 Software Update will probably also
	  install a new libpcap shared library but not install new libpcap
	  headers.

2004-03-21 19:57  jmayer

	* packet-ipdc.h, packet-ipdc.c:

	  Prefix ENUM types ip IPDC_ in order to prevent type clashes with
	  windows includes (MSVC). Proposed fix by Ulf Lamping.

2004-03-21 19:04  jmayer

	* README.macos:

	  mailexchange between Guy Harris and Peter ("downtime").

2004-03-21 17:13  nneul

	* AUTHORS, packet-ipvs-syncd.c, epan/Makefile.common:

2004-03-20 20:06  guy

	* packet-aim.c:

	  From Jelmer Vernooij: add support for SNAC(x,1), SNAC(1,2-6) and
	  SNAC(1,0x13).

2004-03-20 19:09  guy

	* packet-radius.c:

	  If we can't decrypt the user password, display it as hex data,
	  not as text.

	  Make "rdconvertbufftostr()" use "isprint()" to determine whether
	  to display a character as itself or as an escape.  Move our
	  redefinition of "isprint()" above "rdconvertbufftostr()" so that
	  we make the "is it printable?" decision appropriately.

2004-03-20 18:51  guy

	* packet-radius.c:

	  Make a separate display type for the user password, rather than
	  having the code to handle RADIUS_STRING know that User Password
	  has an AVP type value of 2.  As only the User Password field has
	  that display type, we don't have to check whether we're handling
	  vendor-specific VSAs.

2004-03-20 10:47  jmayer

	* packet-ipdc.h:

	  Remove trailing comma

2004-03-20 10:32  jmayer

	* acinclude.m4, epan/acinclude.m4:

	  Workaround for (at least) some RedHat platforms: Add -lresolv in
	  case it's missing but required by the heimdal libs.

2004-03-20 08:32  guy

	* epan/timestamp.c:

	  Make "timestamp_type" static, as all access to it should be
	  through the routines in this file.

2004-03-20 08:01  guy

	* packet-ipdc.c:

	  "tmp_tag_text" can hold a string of up to 255 characters, which
	  means it needs to be 256 characters long to hold a maximum-length
	  string plus a terminating '\0', as noted by Stefan Esser.

	  Don't bother putting in the null terminator at the end in the
	  case where we're putting an IP address or address/port into
	  "tmp_tag_text" - "sprintf()" does that for you.

	  In the case where it's an IP address and port, do it all in one
	  sprintf call - I don't think there's a guarantee that

		  sprintf(tmp_tag_text, "%s:%u", tmp_tag_text, ...)

	  works, although it could work.

	  Also, handle the case where the length is neither 4 (IP address)
	  nor 6 (IP address/port).

2004-03-20 07:49  guy

	* packet-ucp.c:

	  Don't use fixed-length buffers for strings - there's no absolute
	  string length.

2004-03-20 07:26  guy

	* packet-tcap.c:

	  In "dissect_tcap_tid()", check that the length of the transaction
	  ID is <= 4, so we don't copy more than 4 bytes to a 4-byte
	  integer.

2004-03-20 06:34  guy

	* gtk/: main.c, menu.c, proto_draw.c, proto_draw.h:

		  fix the GTK2 code for Expand Tree.

2004-03-20 06:14  guy

	  From Jelmer Vernooij: add support for some more SNACs.

2004-03-20 06:06  guy

	* packet-smb.c:

	  From Ronnie Sahlberg: Windows XP SP1 appears to send the OS and
	  LANMAN fields over the wire in ASCII in SessionSetupandX messages
	  even though the "Unicode strings" flag is set.

2004-03-20 05:53  guy

2004-03-19 10:24  guy

	* packet-e164.c:

	  Use "E.164", not "E164".

	* wiretap/eyesdn.c:

	  "esc_read()" is passed a FILE_T, not a FILE_T * - a FILE_T is a
	  pointer (a FILE * if zlib isn't used, a gzFile if zlib is used).

	  Use "size_t" for the amount of data to read in

	  so that it doesn't get sign-extended.

2004-03-17 08:46  guy

	* packet-gsm_map.c:

	  Unfortunately, GCC 2.8.1 on x86/Solaris 7 doesn't do enough
	  compile-time optimization; in particular, if you call
	  GSM_MAP_PARAM_DISPLAY with a Gtag argument of GSM_MAP_P_NONE, the
	  compiler does figure out that it only need generate code for the
	  first branch for the first if in that macro, and it sort of seems
	  to understand that _param_fcn is guaranteed to be null, but it
	  doesn't optimize out the test and the branch for _param_fcn not
	  being null - it does, however, generate a call to location 0,
	  which, when you compile as position-independent code, the
	  assembler refuses to assemble.

	  Therefore, we put into the test for _param_fcn being null an
	  additional test for Ga1 being GSM_MAP_P_NONE, which at least
	  manages to get the code through the compiler.

	  an older version of libtool that didn't support building them as
	  shared libraries on OS X.

	* gtk/: color_filters.c, color_filters.h:

	  * Color filters:

	  Read of color filters rewritten to remove possibility of buffer
	  overflow in read_filters_file() and to fix comment & blank line
	  handling.  This removes any limitation (and stack overflow) on
	  the lengths of color filter name and filter expression which are
	  now dynamically allocated.

	  Fix removal/deletion of color filters (avoid segmentation fault
	  when some color filter is deleted and then the list cleared for
	  instance).  The use of g_slist_remove() within an iterator is
	  simply unsafe if the code is not prepared to handle this.

	  Fix a small memory leak in revert_filters().

	  Remove inappropriate comments in read_filters().

	  Miscellaneous code cleaning.

	* packet-wbxml.c, packet-text-media.c:

	  Redesigned the token map aggregation.

	  New simpler lists for both known registered WBXML public IDs and
	  unknown lists based on content type value. The latter have the
	  possibility to add a discriminator which facilitates a more
	  correct/appropriate selection of the token map in cases where
	  more (backwards incompatible) versions exist.

	  Now the EXT_T tokens are correctly decoded, and a mapping
	  function can be assigned. This has been done in WML (existing
	  code reused there) and in WV-CSP (new functions looking up a
	  value in a value_string based on the offset after the EXT_T_0
	  token).

	  Add the textual WV-CSP media type to packet-text-media.c.

	  TODO - write the discriminators for WML, SyncML and WV-CSP. Add
	  the code for running the discriminators and possibly iterating
	  over a list of mappings.

	  the BGP dissector does, so that we mask out all the bits that the
	  prefix length tells us to, rather than just masking out entire
	  bytes.

	  Check the prefix length so that we don't overflow the buffer for
	  prefix lengths > 32 - thanks to Stefan Esser for catching that
	  one - and so that we're not confused by a prefix length of 0.

	* packet-dcerpc-netlogon.c, packet-dcerpc-netlogon.h:

	  Kerberos contain a structure that is VERY similar to
	  VALIDATE_SAM_INFO2 so declare it here.  This substructure in the

	  we need to export init_ndr_pointer_list() from packet-dcerpc	so
	  that we can manually call functions to dissect NDR encoded

	  There are NDR encoded blobs that are not encapsulated inside
	  DCERPC such as in kerberos  and those dissectors need this.

	* packet-wbxml.c:

	  Cosmetic fix in WV-CSP tag definitions.

	  Flag a known VERY NASTY bug in WV-CSP 1.2 where a token is being
	  defined twice with the same binary identifier. It's already a
	  mess that they don't provide backwards compatible encodings; you
	  can now write a WV-CSP document without being able to parse it
	  because of version issues (hint: 1.2 has no public WBXML
	  identifier yet and the spec explicitly asks to set it to
	  "Unknown/Missing" so you could write an 1.1 message in 1.2
	  format, which looks *really* weird as the tokens are mixed in
	  both codings).

	  Consequence: I have to foresee a discriminator for the WBXML
	  dissectors so I *may* predict the correct version. I like
	  reviewing in engineering :)

	  Unfortunately, WV-CSP is *never* backwards compatible.
	  Additionally, things get messed up when the WBXML document does
	  *not* contain the WV-CSP DocType.  As a result, I eventually
	  require to let the end-user choose which WV-CSP version they want
	  to see in such cases.

	  Fix code page errors with global tokens (don't depend on code

	  don't leak memory if the copy throws an exception, and don't
	  crash if the length is absurdly large.

	  Use "tvb_memdup()" instead of allocating a buffer and
	  "tvb_memcpy()"ing to it, so that an exception is thrown before
	  you try to allocate the buffer (for the same reasons as listed
	  above).

	  Before allocating a buffer used when processing a chunk of data
	  from a packet, get a pointer to the chunk with "tvb_get_ptr()",
	  or check that the data is all there with
	  "tvb_ensure_bytes_exist()", so that an exception is thrown before
	  you try to allocate the buffer (for the same reasons as listed
	  above).

	  Fix up the lengths of the tvbuff used when dissecting ONC RPC
	  opaque data with a particular dissector.

	* ringbuffer.c:

	  Don't unlink ringbuffer files if we haven't yet allocated the
	  array of ringbuffer files - yes, we can fail before that's done,
	  so we have to check for that.

	* packet-nbns.c, packet-tcp.c, epan/packet.c:

	  with the cahnges to when to call the heuristic dissector (and the
	  fact that nbss does not register its conversation) this caused
	  WANT_PDU_TRACKING to be decremented multiple times between the
	  dissectors and thus ethereal could no longer reliably spot SMB
	  PDUs that started in the middle of a tcp segment (unless we do
	  reassembly which we dont do unless we have to since it eats soo
	  many resources)

	  FIX so that ethereal once again can spot SMB (and other) protocol
	  PDUs that start in the middle of a segment.

2004-02-24 05:52  guy

	* gtk/capture_dlg.c:

	  Small cleanup - the for loop was left over from earlier code that
	  kept searching backwards for a backslash until it found one
	  followed by "Device\", and no longer looped.
