	  As noted by Frédéric Huet, RFC1889 section 6.4 says: "The list of

	  the end of the list, and the remainder as needed to pad until the

	* packet-bacnet.c:

	  Make the calls to build the protocol tree regardless of whether
	  we're building one or not - we have to do some of that work
	  anyway, so we know the offset of the payload and so that we call
	  sub-dissectors, and the easiest way to do that is to do all the
	  work (you make more procedure calls that way than you'd like, but
	  the procedures at least return quickly when they find they've
	  been passed a null pointer; hopefully that won't add too much CPU
	  time to dissection of BACNET traces on the first pass).

	  Don't use "proto_tree_add_uint_format()" in a case where it's not
	  necessary - and fix the field being used not to have a bitmask,
	  as it's not a bitfield.

	  Eliminate a compiler warning by initializing a variable.

	  Don't use "match_strval()" on values you don't know for certain
	  are in the value_string table - use "val_to_str()", so that you
	  don't get a null pointer if the value isn't in that table.
	  ("Know for certain" meaning "the code has made sure it's a value
	  that's in the table", not "the protocol spec says the field must
	  have one of the values in the table".)

	  shows some of the weird Microsoft encryption type values logged

	* packet-ber.c:

	  In the top-level summary item for a bitstring, show the names of

	  blanks as separators doesn't work well if the names themselves
	  have blanks in them, as some of them do.

	  Note that "dissect_ber_integer()" won't work well if the length
	  of the item isn't appropriate for the field, e.g. a length > 4
	  for an FT_INTn or FT_UINTn field.

		  remove "./wiretap" from PATH to prevent problems due to

		  build dissector.lib with MSVC;

		  imports variables from packet-frame.c and packet-data.c,
	  which
		  are in libethereal;

		  move "g711.c" out of the dissector helpers, as they're
	  used only
		  by Ethereal in a tap, not in Tethereal or in any
	  dissector;

		  add a .def file for libethereal;

		  arrange to declare global variables exported from
	  libethereal
		  with "__declspec(dllimport)" when building programs that
	  import
		  those variables;

		  update the NSIS installer.

	* gtk/: main.c, menu.c:

	  Use "main_widgets_show_or_hide()" to control the visibility of

	  is changed.

	  Clean up indentation.

2004-05-04 20:49  guy

	* gtk/: main.c, main.h, menu.c:

	  If all we're doing is changing the visibility of a pane, we don't
	  have to re-lay-out the main window, we just need to change the
	  visibility of the appropriate widgets - that reduces the amount
	  of drawing done, speeding things up a little and reducing
	  flicker.

2004-05-04 20:40  guy

	* gtk/main.c:

	  Display "main_second_pane" if, and only if, both widgets in it
	  are displayed; otherwise, if you hide both of them (e.g., hiding

	  "main_second_pane" remains but as a gray blob, rather than having

	* packet-http.c:

	  Chunked data reassembly *is* done in
	  "req_resp_hdrs_do_reassembly()".

	  That means that the description of the "desegment HTTP bodies"
	  preference setting shouldn't speak of it causing the dissector to
	  trust the content length (which makes it somewhat long anyway),
	  as it also desegments chunked bodies that lack a Content-Length
	  header; expand the tooltip for the preference to speak of that.

2004-05-04 06:53  guy

	* req_resp_hdrs.c:

	  "tvb_get_string()" returns a pointer to "g_malloc()"ed data, so
	  you have to free it when you're done with it.

	  It never returns a null pointer, however, so there's no need to
	  check for that.

	  Clean up the code to process Transfer-Encoding a bit.

2004-05-04 06:21  guy

	* packet-http.c:

	  Note that the way we currently handle the chunked encoding

2004-05-04 06:14  guy

	* packet-dcerpc.c:

	  Display a server boot time of 0 as "Unknown" (as that's what's
	  sent when the client sends its first PDU to the server, and when
	  the endpoint mapper sends back an error PDU on behalf of the
	  server, because they don't know the server's boot time - it's
	  unlikely that the server was booted precisely at January 1, 1970,

2004-05-03 23:37  guy

	* doc/ethereal.pod:

	  The "View" menu has items to show or hide the three display
	  panes; it calls the middle pane the "Packet Details" pane, which
	  is perhaps less geeky than "Protocol Tree".  Update the man page
	  to call it the "packet details".

	  Update the description of the menu items to more closely reflect
	  current reality.

2004-05-03 23:34  guy

	* gtk/menu.c:

	  Move "Coloring Rules" from "View" to "Edit" - you're editing the
	  set of coloring rules Ethereal uses (yes, those views affect the
	  way the packets are displayed, but that also applies to at least
	  some the preferences, which are in Edit->Preferences).

	  Get rid of the "Show" menu under "View", moving the items up to
	  the main "View" menu, as per the GNOME HIG.  Give some of them
	  accelerators, and change the accelerators for some other "View"
	  items to avoid collisions.

	* AUTHORS, packet-http.c, packet-media.c, packet-wsp.c,
	  packet-multipart.c, epan/Makefile.common:

	  Add a generic media dissector. The dissectors trying to find a
	  suitable media dissector for a given media type (value of a
	  Content-Type header) must provide the logic to fall-back to this
	  media dissector upon no match.

	  Note that you must set the pinfo->match_string to the media type
	  name, and if the media type is specified with parameters, then
	  those parameters can be added to pinfo->private_data. If there
	  are no parameters, or the parameter decoding is not implemented,
	  you must set pinfo->private_data to NULL.

	  Known TODOs:

	   - Fix the WSP parameter handling so it accompanies any media
	  dissector.
	     Simplest approach is to retrieve the header field label from
	  the WSP
	     Content-Type field and to search for a semicolon in it (or by
	  using
	     the string length of the content type string representation).

	   - Verify that that subdissection always works in the WSP
	  dissector,
	     even when the protocol tree is not being built.

	   - Implement the media dissector in the remaining dissectors that
	  use the
	     media type string table.

2004-04-30 15:26  obiot

	* packet-http.c:

	  Beware: sscanf() only operates on C strings. A pointer returned

	* TODO:

	  Remove "Display filters: add regexes to strings and byte ranges"
	  as it has been done.

	  Add the possibility to test the packet summary line and the
	  packet dissection to take part in display filter tests:   -
	  summary matches "(?i)response"   - dissection contains "Unknown"

2004-04-25 21:46  guy

2004-04-25 20:42  obiot

	* packet-wsp.c:

	  Fix highlighting of unknown typed parameter bytes (caused an
	  exception to be thrown when expoerting as PDML.

	  Implement the Size parameter (WSP 1.4 encoding).

	  Add the word "parameter" to the parameter header field blurbs.

	  Provide stubs for the not yet implemented typed parameter

	  parameter.

2004-04-25 20:23  guy

	* packet-gprs-llc.c:

	  From Josef Korelus: use "val_to_str()", not "match_strval()", so

	* packet-dcerpc-conv.c:

	  some string clarifications

2004-04-23 05:19  guy

	* Makefile.nmake:

	  From Lars Roland:

		  "make distclean" now removes "cvsversion.h";

		  new "update_plugin_api" which just builds the "xyzzy"
	  target in
		  the plugins subdirectory but makes sure that "config.h"
	  has been
		  generated, added.

2004-04-23 05:16  guy

	* gtk/range_utils.c:

	  Mark some parameters as unused (the GTK+ signal calling sequence
	  requires that they be present).

2004-04-23 04:58  guy

	* packet-tcp.c:

	  From Jon Oberheide: put the "this is a continuation of" item into
	  the protocol tree under the TCP top-level item, rather than at
	  the top level itself, as the protocol hierarchy statistics code
	  can't handle non-protocol items at the top level.

2004-04-23 03:22  guy

	* gtk/file_dlg.c:

	  Get rid of static forward declaration of "toggle_captured_cb()",
	  as it's no longer defined here.

2004-04-23 03:20  guy

	* plugins/megaco/packet-megaco.c:

	  Get rid of bogus extra "proto_tree_add_text()" arguments.

2004-04-23 02:00  gerald

	* gtk/Makefile.am:

	  Add gsm_map_stat.h  and mtp3_stat.h to the distribution.

2004-04-22 21:40  ulfl

	* gtk/: file_dlg.c, print_dlg.c:

	  oops, forgotten to test with GTK1...

2004-04-22 21:29  ulfl

	* gtk/: file_dlg.c, Makefile.am, Makefile.common, range_utils.c,
	  range_utils.h, print_dlg.c:

	  seperated common packet range code from the save and the print
	  dialog, and put it into new range_utils files. This will avoid:
	  a) duplicate code in save and print dialog and b) yet another
	  code duplication for future dialogs (export, ...)

2004-04-22 20:31  jmayer

	* packet-ipdc.h:

	  No comma after last element in enum

2004-04-22 20:29  jmayer

	  From Martin Mathieson add 2 hidden display filters for SIP -
	  namely: (1)  sip.error (for all responses with code >= 300) (2)
	  sip.resend (for all packets that appear to have been
	  retransmitted). A field showing a count of these is shown in the
	  SIP stats window.

	* file.c, print.c, print.h, print.ps, tethereal.c, gtk/print_dlg.c:

	  added some options and enhancements to the print output: -ps:
	  added formatting hints for ghostscript, so pdf conversion will be
	  much better -ps: print a thin line at the top and bottom of each
	  page -ps/text: add an option to start a new page for every packet
	  (formfeed)

2004-04-22 08:22  guy

	  long lines

2004-04-20 19:27  obiot

	* packet-wsp.c:

	  Fix the Content-Type parameter rendering as sometimes the code
	  was adding its value to the header field and sometimes to its
	  label in the protocol tree only.

2004-04-20 13:15  gerald

	* AUTHORS, doc/ethereal.pod:

	  Update Thierry Pelle's address.

2004-04-20 08:33  sahlberg

	* packet-ldap.c:

	  try to dissect the ms cldap netlogon rpc  flags bits.  the
	  information comes from the samba sources and may or may not be
	  reliable or menaingful.

	  ms documentation in their knowledgebase says that the only really
	  important part in the netlogon response is the sitename.

	  (i have reasons to belive at least one of the flags,	closest, is
	  completely bogous)

2004-04-20 05:32  ulfl

		  Handle TLV's in a somewhat more extendible manner.

		  Fix a bug in the buddylist dissector that caused pango
	  warnings.

2004-04-20 04:17  guy

	* packet-acse.c, packet-ftam.c:

	  From Yuriy Sidelnikov: add a dissector table for OIDs to the ACSE
	  dissector, and make the FTAP dissector register itself in that
	  table.

2004-04-19 23:36  obiot

	* packet-ip.c:

	  Add a textual "(Dont Fragment)" and "(More Fragments)" to the
	  ip.flags line in case the DF bit or the MF bit is set.

2004-04-19 23:26  obiot

	* packet-wbxml.c:

	  Fix a bug in the processing of WV-CSP OPAQUE data (TCPAddress was
	  Integer in WV-CSP 1.0 but became a String from WV-CSP 1.1
	  onwards).

	  The token code page 3 of WV-CSP 1.2 is the same as in WV-CSP 1.1
	  (not 1.0).

2004-04-19 22:41  guy

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  Put the value(s) of a parameter into the top-level item for that
	  parameter, and clean up the display of the value(s) under that
	  item.

2004-04-19 20:20  guy

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  Add length checks to submessages.

	  Clean up the handling of parameter sequences - add a bunch of
	  length checking, give each parameter a protocol tree item with
	  the ID/length/value under it, and don't format variable-length
	  string parameters into fixed-length buffers.	Use the
	  parameter-sequence dissector for the ISSUE message.

	  Use the "number of bits" value when dissecting a bitmap.

2004-04-19 08:26  guy

	* AUTHORS, doc/ethereal.pod:

	  Update Pasi Eronen's e-mail address.

2004-04-19 08:19  guy

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  Use a "while()" loop, rather than a "do { ... } while()" loop, in
	  "dissect_rtps()", just in case a message with *no* submessages is
	  sent.

	  Fetch the flags field in that loop, as we need the E bit value to
	  determine the byte order of the "next submessage offset" field;
	  fetch that value in the loop as well, and pass both those values,
	  and the byte-order flag, to submessage dissector routines as
	  necessary.

	  Make the main protocol tree item for each submessage cover the
	  entire submessage; put into that protocol tree an item that
	  covers the submessage ID, with a named field.

	  Construct the submessage subtree in that loop, rather than in the
	  submessage dissectors.

	  Put into that subtree items for the flags and next submessage
	  offset; we do that in the submessage dissector, as the
	  interpretation of the bits in the flags field differs from
	  submessage to submessage.

2004-04-18 20:08  guy

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  The "next_submsg" argument passed to "get_bitmap()" is an offset
	  within the tvbuff, not a relative offset, so it should just be a
	  "gint".

2004-04-18 19:52  guy

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  Get rid of an unused variable.

2004-04-18 18:55  guy

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  Make "little_endian" local to the routines to parse submessages.

	  Before checking for the "RTPS" tag, make sure we have at least 4
	  bytes in the message.

	  Use "tvb_reported_length()" to get the length of the message, so
	  we throw an exception on a packet cut short by a snapshot length.

	  Put in a comment asking whether the byte order of the "offset to
	  next submessage" field is little-endian or specified by the E
	  bit.

2004-04-18 10:16  obiot

	* README.win32:

	  Update the cygwin build instructions (plugins can now be compiled
	  too).

	  Hint on how cygwin gcc can be used to compile a native Win32
	  Ethereal.

2004-04-18 06:41  ulfl

	* README.win32:

	  added a small section about the supported compilers

2004-04-18 06:40  ulfl

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  removed some MSVC warnings

2004-04-18 06:39  ulfl

	* packet-rtps.h:

	  replaced some integer types by glib ones, to be able to compile
	  again on win32

2004-04-17 22:11  guy

	* packet-rtps.c:

	  Put "#" in pre-processor keywords at the beginning of the line -
	  I seem to remember that at least at one point in the history of
	  C, at least one compiler required that.

	  Clean up the byte-order stuff - LITTLE_ENDIAN and BIG_ENDIAN
	  aren't defined by Ethereal or GLib, so we shouldn't use them
	  (some platforms might define them, but at least some platforms
	  define them *both* as non-zero values, so they can't be used as
	  "true or false" values for "e_bit"), and we don't need to worry
	  about the byte order of the machine running Ethereal - we should
	  just use Ethereal's standard routines to fetch little-endian or
	  big-endian values.

	  Get rid of C++ comments.

2004-04-17 21:43  guy

	* AUTHORS, Makefile.common, packet-rtps.c, packet-rtps.h,
	  doc/ethereal.pod, epan/Makefile.common:

2004-04-17 20:58  guy

	* packet-mq.c:

	  Updates from metatech:

		  - Added SPI messages.

2004-04-17 09:02  ulfl

	* print.c:

	  PDML output: if a protocol field is invisible, add the attribute:
	  hide="yes" to the field node

2004-04-17 04:43  guy

	* packet-q931.c:

	  Neaten up the display of the top-level protocol tree item for a
	  number IE.

2004-04-17 03:38  guy

	* packet-x11.c, x11-fields:

	  In EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events, the last byte isn't a
	  Boolean, it's a bitmask with "focus" and "same-screen" bits.

2004-04-17 03:02  guy

	* packet-diameter.c:

	  The value returned by "diameter_avp_get_value()" is used only in
	  protocol tree items that also have the AVP value in the text, so
	  there's no reason to have the string returned by
	  "diameter_avp_get_value()" contain that value as well - it's
	  redundant.

2004-04-17 01:12  guy

	* gtk/color_dlg.c:

	  Confirmation dialogs should be marked as such.

2004-04-17 01:09  guy

	* gtk/: capture_dlg.c, capture_prefs.c:

	  Failure to get the list of interfaces should be reported as an
	  error.

2004-04-17 01:07  guy

	* capture.c:

	  Failures when capturing should be reported as errors.

2004-04-17 01:05  guy

	* dftest.c:

	  Update to handle the changed epan_init() API, with a "general
	  failure" routine added.  Add a missing newline to the end of read
	  failure messages.

2004-04-17 01:01  guy

	* gtk/io_stat.c:

	  Report problems due to the user specifying something we can't
	  handle as errors, not warnings.

2004-04-16 23:57  guy

	* gtk/main.c:

	  Report errors in opening various configuration files at the time
	  the failure occurs; now that "simple_dialog()" queues up messages
	  if we don't yet have the main window, those messages will be
	  queued up until then.

	  Move the point at which we pop up those queued messages after the
	  "process all pending GUI events" is done, so that those messages
	  are properly displayed on top of the main window.

	  gtk/main.c, gtk/simple_dialog.c, plugins/plugin_api_list.c,
	  plugins/Xass-list, plugins/Xplugin_api.c, plugins/Xplugin_api.h,
	  plugins/Xplugin_api_decls.h, plugins/Xplugin_table.h:

	  Add a "report_failure()" routine to allow dissectors to report
	  arbitrary errors to the user.  Use that, rather than
	  "g_warning()", in the Diameter dissector to report errors reading
	  the dictionary.

	  Make the format argument to "simple_dialog()" a "const" pointer.

	  Fix up the read-error message in Tethereal to end with a newline.

	  If a simple dialog is requested before the main window or the
	  capture-control window is popped up, queue it up and pop the
	  queued messages up once the main or capture-control window is
	  displayed.

2004-04-16 22:44  obiot

	* packet-wbxml.c:

	  Add a discriminator for WV-CSP so the correct version is used for
	  rendering the WBXML tokens in WV-CSP.

	  Provide rendering of OPAQUE data for media types, based on a
	  framework of 4 functions that take care of well-known and literal
	  tags and attribute names for deciding on the meaning of the
	  OPAQUE data. Applied to SI, EMN and WV-CSP.

	  Update reference URLs for WAP, OMA and related specs.

	  Note: as the WBXML common code only takes ~2000 lines while the
	  token mappings take ~4000 lines, maybe it is time to envisage
	  writing the per-media mappings to dedicated source files
	  (packet-wbxml-wml.c, packet-wbxml-wv_csp.c etc)?

2004-04-16 20:20  guy

	* file.c:

	  If we're printing summaries and packet detail or hex dump
	  information, print the header before each summary line, and print
	  a blank line separating the summary line and the remaining
	  information.

2004-04-16 19:36  guy

	* gtk/: color_dlg.c, color_filters.c, color_filters.h:

	  Make "new_color_filter()" take the background and foreground
	  colors, as GdkColors, as arguments.

2004-04-16 19:05  guy

	* gtk/color_filters.c:

	  You have to initialize a GtkColor structure before passing it to
	  "get_color()" - otherwise, GDK will allocate a color from the
	  colormap to match whatever random values happen to be there.

2004-04-16 18:17  ulfl

	* file.c, print.c, tethereal.c, gtk/print_dlg.c:

	  make print dialog "Packet Format" options somewhat similar to the
	  Ethereal panes, thus better understandable

2004-04-16 05:30  ulfl

	* gtk/print_dlg.c:

	  bugfix: make the "no dissections" radiobutton insensitive, if
	  packet details isn't selected

2004-04-15 23:28  guy

	* cfile.h, file.c, gtk/find_dlg.c:

	  Rename a bunch of variables and routines that pertain to string
	  search with "string" rather than "ascii", to make it clearer what
	  they're involved with.

	  Use "gtk_toggle_button_set_active()", not
	  "gtk_toggle_button_set_state()" (the latter is a deprecated alias
	  for the former, probably dating back to GTK+ 1.0[.x] - 1.2[.x]
	  and later have "gtk_toggle_button_set_active()").

	  Do *NOT* change the radio buttons for the type of string search
	  to do based on whether we're doing a string search or not - doing
	  so means we don't correctly remember the type of string search.

	  Get rid of code to fetch some values that we don't subsequently
	  use.

2004-04-15 22:38  obiot

	* packet-wbxml.c:

	  Add two preferences to the WBXML dissector: - Control the
	  rendering of WBXML tokens to a media type token mapping.  -
	  Control the dissection of the tokens that make up the WBXML body.
	   Both preferences are OFF by default.

	  Fix some comments as they did not reflect the current state
	  anymore.

2004-04-15 19:56  ulfl

	* print.c, print.h, gtk/print_dlg.c:

	  Add support for plugin dissectors on cygwin builds, by adding the
	  following line to every Makefile.am file for a given plugin XXX:

		  XXX_la_LIBADD = -L../../epan -lethereal @GLIB_LIBS@

	  This way symbols defined in libethereal and GLib are resolved
	  when linking the plugin dissector modules.

2004-04-14 18:42  obiot

	* configure.in, epan/ftypes/Makefile.am, wiretap/configure.in:

	  Use the "a_bit" true_false_string for the "llcgprs.as" field.

2004-04-13 21:29  guy

	* packet-sndcp.c:

	  Change the decision tree for protocol and data compression so
	  that it doesn't test all four possibilities - with the old code,
	  GCC doesn't understand that one of the four possibilities must be
	  true, so it complains that "compression_field_item" might not be
	  set, but it does understand that with the new code.

2004-04-13 18:01  tuexen

2004-04-03 03:50  guy

	* packet-smb-common.c:

	  In "get_unicode_or_ascii_string()", treat a negative length
	  argument as a very large unsigned integer (which it probably is),
	  and trim it at INT_MAX, and fix the handling of too-long ASCII
	  strings so that the "..." gets inserted.  Make sure that all the
	  bytes of the string exist before truncating the string length to
	  the buffer length, so that the appropriate exception is thrown.

2004-04-03 00:29  sahlberg

	* packet-rpc.c:

	  Add a new preference option so that users that really really want
	  to can tell ethereal "I dont care if the heuristics are too weak"
	  "I want to see the ONC-RPC layer for these weird protocols that
	  are not known to ethereal"   "If I get a lot of false positives
	  it is my own fault and I will not complain"

	  This allows ethereal to dissect the rpc layer (and do
	  request/response matching) even for those onc-rpc protocols that
	  ethereal doesnt know about yet.

2004-04-02 22:01  sahlberg

	* packet-spnego.c:

	  If the packet is short,  dont try to create a blob item that
	  spans beyound the end of the short packet since that will raise
	  an exception and we wont even attempt to dissect those (kerberos
	  usually) bytes that we do have in the packet.

2004-04-02 21:38  sahlberg

	* packet-smb.c:

	  dont bail out just because we dont have the entire security blob

	  as possible to gssapi.

2004-04-02 09:04  guy

2004-04-02 08:27  guy

	* wiretap/: nettl.c, nettl.h:

	  From Mark C. Brown: add support for FDDI and Token Ring cards.

	  Set the file encapsulation the same way it's done for iptrace
	  captures - leave it as "unknown" to start with, and, for each
	  packet we see, set it to the packet's encapsulation type if the
	  file encapsulation type is unknown and set it to "per-packet" if
	  the file encapsulation type is "known" but isn't the type of that
	  packet, so files that have all the same type of packet have that
	  type as the file type and packets that *don't* have all the same
	  type of packet have "per-packet".

	  The extension ID field in a Private Extension IU is 2 bytes, so
	  the length of the IU must be at least 2 bytes in order to dissect
	  the contents.

	  Just use "proto_tree_add_item()" to add the value of the private
	  extension, and do so only if it's not zero-length.

	* packet-mip6.c:

	  Fix the length used for the protocol tree item for Mobile IPv6
	  options.

	* packet-aim-location.c:

	  From Devin Heitmueller: put back the info level for the user info
	  request.

	* config.guess, config.sub, packet-dcerpc-lsa.c,
	  packet-dcerpc-samr.c, packet-dcerpc-spoolss.c,
	  packet-dcerpc-svcctl.c, packet-smb-common.h, packet-smb.c:

	  Add the mask for an NT ACL ACE to the summary list for each ACE.
	  This means we don't have to expand the ACE to see what the
	  permission mask is.

	  There are a couple of other places where this could be used, but
	  I have not done anything about them.

	* gtk/dlg_utils.c:

	  It *appears* that if you don't explicitly request that a file
	  chooser dialog be centered on its parent, it still gets so
	  centered; we remove the call to do so from the GTK+ >= 2.4 file
	  selection dialog creation code.

2004-03-29 23:03  guy

	* gtk/dlg_utils.c:

	  In a "save" dialog, the "yes" button should be a "Save" button,
	  not an "Open" button.

2004-03-29 22:55  guy

	* gtk/: dlg_utils.c, dlg_utils.h, file_dlg.c:

	  Add another wrapper routine, "file_selection_set_extra_widget()",
	  to set the "extra options" portion of a file selection dialog,
	  and use it rather than #if'ed code.

2004-03-29 22:40  guy

	* gtk/: capture_dlg.c, dlg_utils.c, dlg_utils.h, file_dlg.c,
	  follow_dlg.c, print_prefs.c:

	  Make "file_selection_new()" take as its second argument an
	  Ethereal-defined indication of the action (open vs. save),
	  regardless of whether we're building for GTK+ >= 2.4 or not; we
	  just ignore the argument in pre-2.4 GTK+.

	  Use "file_selection_new()" rather than #if'ed code to use it or
	  "gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new()"  for GTK+ >= 2.4 and
	  "gtk_file_selection_new()" or it for pre-2.4 GTK+.

	  Add a "file_selection_set_current_folder()" routine that does the
	  appropriate thing depending on whether we're GTK+ >= 2.4 or not,
	  and use that rather than #if'ed code to use
	  "gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder()" or
	  "gtk_file_selection_set_filename()".

	* packet-eapol.c:

	  From Jouni Malinen:

		  Small changes for EAPOL-Key dissector for IEEE
	  802.11i/RSN:
		  - add Encrypted Key Data flag for key info
		  - do not try to parse EAPOL-Key Key Data if it is
	  encrypted
		    (RSN: Encrypted Key Data flag, WPA: Group Key)
		  - Key Index and Key ID are reserved in RSN

	* gtk/: capture_dlg.c, file_dlg.c:

	  minor code cleanup, including removed MSVC warnings

	* aclocal-fallback/: glib-2.0.m4, glib.m4, gtk-2.0.m4, gtk.m4:

	  Fix some aclocal warnings during autogen.sh

2004-03-27 12:07  jmayer

	* acinclude.m4, wiretap/acinclude.m4:

	  Some aclocal warning fixes during autogen.sh

2004-03-27 11:53  guy

	* packet-tcp.c:

	  From Ronnie Sahlberg: RST and FIN segments are neither
	  zero-window packets nor duplicate ACKs.

2004-03-27 11:52  jmayer

	* autogen.sh, configure.in:

	  OK, I'm impatient. In case of problems, I'm to blame, not
	  Olivier.

	  Olivier Biot:   Merge epan/configure.in back into configure.in
	  Leave epan/confiugre.in and epan/acinclude.m4 in case we need to
			undo this.

	* process-x11-fields.pl:

	  From Gisle Vanem: add a "this is a generated file" comment to the

	* wiretap/: nettl.c, nettl.h:

	  From Mark C. Brown: add support for iether (dual-port gigabit)
	  cards in nettl files.

	* gtk/: bootp_stat.c, h225_counter.c, h225_ras_srt.c, http_stat.c,
	  mgcp_stat.c, sip_stat.c, wsp_stat.c:

	  From Lars Roland: use the generic filter dialog for the SIP,
	  HTTP, WSP, and BOOTP taps.

	  Get rid of the "dlg" variable in some of those taps - it's never
	  set, so it's always null, and nothing useful is done with it if
	  it's null.

	  Make static some variables and functions not used outside the
	  source file in which they're defined.
