Ethereal 0.9.8 has been released.


New and Updated Features

  The TAP subsystem received major updates.  Tethereal can display
  more statistics, and several graphs have been added to Ethereal.

  A protocol hierarchy statistics tap was added to tethereal.  This code
  may be used to replace the hierarchy statistics code in Ethereal.
  
  More updates have been added to TCP analysis.

  After a long hiatus, the Windows installer once again includes SNMP
  support.

  The total running time of the capture is now displayed in the capture
  progress dialog box.  The capture progress dialog also shows ARP packets.

  The look of the plugins dialog was revamped.


Bug Fixes and Updates

  A bug which caused Ethereal under Windows to crash when "Update list of
  packets in real time" was enabled has been fixed.

  Serious problems with the BGP, LMP, PPP, and TDS dissectors have been
  discovered.  See 
  
    http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00007.html
  
  for more details.

  The stability of the text2pcap utility has been improved.

  In tethereal, the packet count is properly displayed when you ^C out of a
  capture.

Ethereal 0.9.7 has been released.

New Features

  In order to improve the out-of-box responsiveness of Ethereal and
  Tethereal, network name resolution has been disabled by default.

  TCP analysis (a feature added in the 0.9.6 release) was improved.

  The NCP code base received quite a few updates.

  Initial support for version 2 of the GTK+ library was added.

  RPC staticstics (which use the new Tap API) were added.

  Due to added and updated support for the NTLM, SNEGO, and GSS-API
  protocols, Ethereal can now dissect most of the security blobs for
  Windows 2000 authentication.

  The Ethernet "manuf" file now handles addresses specified with a
  mask, and  contains many well-known addresses.

Ethereal 0.9.6 has been released.

Bugs Fixed

  A buffer overflow in the ISIS dissector has been fixed.  More
  information can be found at

  A bad TCP header could cause problems for the "Follow TCP Stream"
  feature.
  
  Setting "column.format" from the command line no longer crashes
  Ethereal and Tethereal.

  Problems with capture files being overwritten (e.g. if you try to save over
  the current capture file) have been fixed.

  An SMB conversation handling bug has been fixed.

  Thanks to Valgrind, several memory leaks have been fixed.

  Some problems with printing under Windows have been fixed.


New Features

  TCP sequence number analysis has been added.
