Ethereal 0.9.7 has been released.

New Features

  In order to improve the out-of-box responsiveness of Ethereal and
  Tethereal, network name resolution has been disabled by default.

  TCP analysis (a feature added in the 0.9.6 release) was improved.

  The NCP code base received quite a few updates.

  Initial support for version 2 of the GTK+ library was added.

  RPC staticstics (which use the new Tap API) were added.

  Due to added and updated support for the NTLM, SNEGO, and GSS-API
  protocols, Ethereal can now dissect most of the security blobs for
  Windows 2000 authentication.

  The Ethernet "manuf" file now handles addresses specified with a
  mask, and  contains many well-known addresses.

Bugs Fixed

  A buffer overflow in the ISIS dissector has been fixed.  More
  information can be found at

  A bad TCP header could cause problems for the "Follow TCP Stream"
  feature.
  
  Setting "column.format" from the command line no longer crashes
  Ethereal and Tethereal.

  Problems with capture files being overwritten (e.g. if you try to save over
  the current capture file) have been fixed.

  An SMB conversation handling bug has been fixed.

  Thanks to Valgrind, several memory leaks have been fixed.

  Some problems with printing under Windows have been fixed.
