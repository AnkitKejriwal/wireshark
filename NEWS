  for more details.


New and Updated Features

  The TAP subsystem received major updates.  Tethereal can display
  more statistics, and several graphs have been added to Ethereal.

  A protocol hierarchy statistics tap was added to tethereal.  This code
  may be used to replace the hierarchy statistics code in Ethereal.
  
  More updates have been added to TCP analysis.

  After a long hiatus, the Windows installer once again includes SNMP
  support.

  The total running time of the capture is now displayed in the capture
  progress dialog box.  The capture progress dialog also shows ARP packets.

  The look of the plugins dialog was revamped.


Bug Fixes and Updates

  A bug which caused Ethereal under Windows to crash when "Update list of
  packets in real time" was enabled has been fixed.

  The stability of the text2pcap utility has been improved.

  In tethereal, the packet count is properly displayed when you ^C out of a
  capture.
