Wireshark 0.99.3 has been released.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer.
   It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development, and
   education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following vulnerabilities have been fixed:

     o The SCSI dissector could crash. Versions affected: 0.99.2.

     o If Wireshark was compiled with ESP decryption support, the
       IPsec ESP preference parser was susceptible to off-by-one
       errors. Versions affected: 0.99.2.

     o The DHCP dissector (and possibly others) in the Windows
       version of Wireshark could trigger a bug in Glib and crash.
       Versions affected: 0.10.13 - 0.99.2.

     o If the SSCOP dissector has a port range configured and the
       SSCOP payload protocol is Q.2931, a malformed packet could
       make the Q.2931 dissector use up available memory. No port
       range is configured by default. Versions affected: 0.7.9 -
       0.99.2.

   The following bugs have been fixed:

     o The VOIP call analysis feature could cause an assertion.

     o The RTP analysis feature could freeze for an extended period.

     o Selecting "Apply as Filter" wouldn't work for some tree items.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since the last release:

     o ESP, Kerberos, and SSL decryption are now supported in the
       Windows installer. (As as result, Wireshark is now subject to
       United States export controls.)

     o The packet list context menu now includes a conversation
       filter.

     o Wireshark can now generate ACL rules for several popular
       firewall products.

     o Wireshark now supports AirPcap, including raw 802.11 captures
       under Windows.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   the [1]download page on the main web site.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
   can be found on the [2]download page on the Wireshark web site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

Known Problems

   On Windows systems the packet list scroll bar can sometimes
   disappear or become unusable. Until the problem is fixed you can
   work around it by resizing the packet list or the main window.

   The Filter button is nonfunctional in the file dialogs under
