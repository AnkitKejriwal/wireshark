"There is no need to tell Ethereal what type of file you are reading; it will determine the file type by itself. Ethereal is also capable of reading any of these file formats if they are compressed using gzip. Ethereal recognizes this directly from the file; the '.gz' extension is not required for this purpose. \n"
