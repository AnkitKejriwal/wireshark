/*
 * If you're adding a new routine, please add it to the *end* of this
 * table, so that the ABI remains backwards-compatible if the only change
 * is that new functions are added; don't bother trying to keep related
 * routines together.  (This list is included in "plugin_table.h" to
 * declare the members of the function address table, so the order *does*
 * matter.)
 *
 * If a routine is removed or a calling sequence changed, the ABI isn't
 * going to be backwards-compatible no matter what you do; if that's
 * done, you may re-shuffle the routines to put related routines
 * together if you want.
