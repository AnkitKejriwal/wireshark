Starts to work so I check it in.

This is an interface to the Lua programming language.

http://www.lua.org

I've already wrote a simple dissector that calls another dissectors.

soon It will be able to register a tap and do something more.

I did not checkin changes to the Makefiles so in order to use it you must change the
makefiles.

Other than that to get it to work you need to download lua-5.0.2.tar.gz into the plugin
directory, uncompress it, cd to it and call make.

the interface is buggy and far from finished, time will help on this.
