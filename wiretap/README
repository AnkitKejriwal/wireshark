Wiretap is a library that is being developed as a future replacement for
libpcap, the current standard Unix library for packet capturing. Libpcap is
great in that it is very platform independent and has a wonderful BPF
optimizing engine. But it has some shortcomings as well. These shortcomings
came to a head during the development of Ethereal (http://ethereal.zing.org),
a packet analyzer. As such, I began developing wiretap so that:

1. The library can easily be amended with new packet filtering objects.
Libpcap is very TCP/IP-oriented. I want to filter on IPX objects, SNA objects,
etc. I also want any decent programmer to be able to add new filters to the
library.

2. The library can read file formats from many packet-capturing utilities.
Libpcap only reads Libpcap files.

3. The library can capture on more than one network interface at a time, and
save this trace in one file.

4. Network names can be resolved immediately after a trace and saved in the
trace file. That way, I can ship a trace of my firewall-protected network to a
colleague, and he'll see the proper hostnames for the IP addresses in the
packet capture, even though he doesn't have access to the DNS server behind my
LAN's firewall.

5. I want to look into the possibility of compressing packet data when saved
to a file, like Sniffer.


Currently, only #2 is available. Wiretap doesn't even do any filtering yet. It
can only be used to read packet capture files.
