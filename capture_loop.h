#ifndef HAVE_PCAP_BREAKLOOP
/*
 * We don't have pcap_breakloop(), which is the only way to ensure that
 * pcap_dispatch(), pcap_loop(), or even pcap_next() or pcap_next_ex()
 * won't, if the call to read the next packet or batch of packets is
 * is interrupted by a signal on UN*X, just go back and try again to
 * read again.
 *
 * On UN*X, we catch SIGUSR1 as a "stop capturing" signal, and, in
 * the signal handler, set a flag to stop capturing; however, without
 * a guarantee of that sort, we can't guarantee that we'll stop capturing
 * if the read will be retried and won't time out if no packets arrive.
 *
 * Therefore, on at least some platforms, we work around the lack of
 * pcap_breakloop() by doing a select() on the pcap_t's file descriptor
 * to wait for packets to arrive, so that we're probably going to be
 * blocked in the select() when the signal arrives, and can just bail
 * out of the loop at that point.
 *
 * However, we don't want to that on BSD (because "select()" doesn't work
 * correctly on BPF devices on at least some releases of some flavors of
 * BSD), and we don't want to do it on Windows (because "select()" is
 * something for sockets, not for arbitrary handles).  (Note that "Windows"
 * here includes Cygwin; even in its pretend-it's-UNIX environment, we're
 * using WinPcap, not a UNIX libpcap.)
 *
 * Fortunately, we don't need to do it on BSD, because the libpcap timeout
 * on BSD times out even if no packets have arrived, so we'll eventually
 * exit pcap_dispatch() with an indication that no packets have arrived,
 * and will break out of the capture loop at that point.
 *
 * On Windows, we can't send a SIGUSR1 to stop capturing, so none of this
 * applies in any case.
 *
 * XXX - the various BSDs appear to define BSD in <sys/param.h>; we don't
 * want to include it if it's not present on this platform, however.
