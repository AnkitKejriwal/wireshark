# this is an example snmp_users_file

# comments start with a # and finish at the end of line
# empty lines are ignored 

# each record has the following fileds
# engine-id username auth_pass priv_pass auth_proto priv_proto
# fileds are separated by whitespace
# engine-id, username and passwds can be either "double quoted" or hex
# double quoted strings are c-style strings and take escape chars
# a '*' as engine-id matches any any given engine-id
# auth_proto can be either MD5 or SHA1.
# priv_proto can be either DES or AES Defaults to DES if not given
# protocols are case-insensitive (md5 == MD5)
# first match wins (place localized entries before those for any engine)
