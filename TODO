Things to do:
=============

1. Protocol dispatchers, allowing run-time setting of protocol "chaining"
(i.e., UDP port X calls dissector Y)

2. Loadable modules, closely related to the previous item.

3. Work on packet capturing in wiretap

4. I just discovered that sshd sets the SSH_CLIENT variable to source IP,
sort port, and destination port. That coupled with a destination IP
would give us enough information to carry out remote protocol capturing,
tcpdump over ssh:

	ssh remotehost tcpdump -s 2000 -w - filter,

where "filter" filters out our own ssh packets (using the infromation
from $SSH_CLIENT). Any takers?

5. Of course, packet defragmentating. IP, TCP, UDP, need to be reassembled
and re-analyzed.

6. I'd like to someday re-write the display filter routines to have a more
powerful syntax.

7. More on-line help, and neato things with the protocol tree and
right-clicks.

8. A GtkClist replacement, with dynamic columns.

9. A GUI capture/display filter creator.

10. Run-time configuration of tunnelling protocols -- display tunnelled
protocol as data or as a full-fledged protocol (which subtree do we put
it under?)

11. Run-time configuration of data shown in capture statistics window.

12. A GtkWidget for authors in the About box. We've got a lot of authors!

13. Finish moving GTK-dependent code into gtk/ subdirectory.
