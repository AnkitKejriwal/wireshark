/* A protocol dissector can be called in 2 different ways:

	(a) Operational dissection

		In this mode, Ethereal is only interested in the way protocols
		interact, protocol conversations are created, packets are reassembled
		and handed over to higher-level protocol dissectors.
		In this mode Ethereal does not build a so-called "protocol tree".

	(b) Detailed dissection

		In this mode, Ethereal is also interested in all details of a given
		protocol, so a "protocol tree" is created.

   Ethereal distinguishes between the 2 modes with the proto_tree pointer:
	(a) <=> tree == NULL
	(b) <=> tree != NULL

   In the interest of speed, if "tree" is NULL, avoid building a
   protocol tree and adding stuff to it, or even looking at any packet
   data needed only if you're building the protocol tree, if possible.

   Note, however, that you must fill in column information, create
   conversations, reassemble packets, build any other persistent state
   needed for dissection, and call subdissectors regardless of whether
   "tree" is NULL or not.  This might be inconvenient to do without
   doing most of the dissection work; the routines for adding items to
   the protocol tree can be passed a null protocol tree pointer, in
   which case they'll return a null item pointer, and
   "proto_item_add_subtree()" returns a null tree pointer if passed a
   null item pointer, so, if you're careful not to dereference any null
   tree or item pointers, you can accomplish this by doing all the
   dissection work.  This might not be as efficient as skipping that
   work if you're not building a protocol tree, but if the code would
   have a lot of tests whether "tree" is null if you skipped that work,
   you might still be better off just doing all that work regardless of
   whether "tree" is null or not. */
