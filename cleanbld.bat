rem Remove the config.h files that are built from config.h.win32 files,
rem so that a build will reconstruct them; this should be run the first
rem time you do a Microsoft Visual C++ build, so that, for example, if
rem you've done a UNIX build, the build doesn't use the config.h files
rem from that build (using those config.h files will cause the build
rem to fail).
